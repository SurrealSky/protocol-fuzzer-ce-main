		One or more routes can be configured for use with the Peach Fuzzing Web Proxy feature.
		Each route contains several configuration parameters.
		Route entries are matched in order.
		It’s recommended that a final route entry be included with a Route pattern of 
		<code>*</code> as a catch all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Adding multiple routes allows different configurations based on matching a portion of the Path.
		For example, 
		if two different APIs are accessed during testing 
		<code>/storage/*</code> and 
		<code>/users/*</code>, 
		each can have a different route entry allowing for different fault status codes or 
		Swagger API specifications.
