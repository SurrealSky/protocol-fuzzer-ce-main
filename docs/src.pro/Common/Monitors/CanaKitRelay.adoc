== CanaKitRelay Monitor

*Monitor category*: *Automation*

The _CanaKitRelay_ monitor provides automation to a number of test configurations:

* Control power to an external device that is the fuzzing target.
You can turn it on at the start of the test,
then toggle power after a fault occurs to return the device to a known, stable state.
* Control a supporting device in a fuzzing test configuration.
Supporting devices can include recording devices,
lighting,
heating devices,
sound or motion generators.
An example is turning on an espresso machine after every 10,000th test iteration.
* Emulate a button push by inserting the device into a circuit containing the button.
The idea is to automate the press of a button,
such as `NumLock`,
or the play button on a surveillance device.
* For simulating the attachment or removal of a cable,
such as USB,
by routing the power line (VCC) through the relay.

The CanaKit is an external product that you can add as part of your test configuration.
The kit consists of 4 relays.
A relay is an electrically operated switch that uses an electromagnet to operate a switching mechanism. Each relay in the kit is capable of controlling a 5-amp,
110V AC or a 24V DC circuit.
Communication with the kit occurs over USB.

For more information on the kit,
including configurations,
installation,
and the relay command set,
see http://www.canakit.com/4-port-usb-relay-controller.html[CanaKit 4-Port USB Relay Controller].

You can purchase the CanaKit from the manufacturer at the previous web site or from Amazon.com.
In each case,
the kit price is about $60.00 U.S. plus shipping costs.

The _CanaKitRelay_ monitor controls one relay in a kit.
Use one monitor per relay to control multiple relays concurrently.
Within a fuzzing session,
the monitor can trigger the relay at the following times:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* During the detection of a fault
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault
* When a specified call is received from the state model


The following diagram shows a sample configuration that controls power through Relay 1.

image::{images}/Common/Monitors/CanaKitRelay.png[scalewidth="75%"]

Each relay supplies three terminals:
Normally Open (NO),
Common (COM),
and Normally Closed (NC).
Basic configurations will connect the hot wire to Common and the other wire to either NO or NC.
For DC connections,
attach the anode (+) to the Common terminal.

NO provides an open circuit when the relay is off.
NC provides a closed circuit when the relay is off,
giving opposite on/off states from NO.
The following diagram shows the terminal layout and imagines that Relay 1 is On.

TIP: The CanaKit Relay requires a driver that is available at the supplier's website.
At the time of this writing,
the driver is unsigned,
which forces you to turn off Driver Signing Enforcement when installing the driver in 64-bit Windows 8.
For instructions on how to install unsigned drivers in this environment,
see http://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/[How to Disable Driver Signature Verification on 64-Bit Windows 8.1].

After installing the CanaKit device driver,
connect the unit to your PC.
Windows dynamically assigns a serial port to the USB channel for the connection.
You can see the port assignment by looking at the `Ports(COM and LPT)` entry in the Device Manager.
The Device Manager is available from the System applet in the Control Panel.

NOTE: For controlling power to devices using 3-prong outlets, Peach
provides the xref:Monitors_IpPower9258[IpPower9258],
xref:Monitors_ApcPower[ApcPower], and
xref:Monitors_SnmpPower[SnmpPower] monitors.

=== Parameters

_Required:_

SerialPort::
Serial port for the board (such as COM2).

RelayNumber::
Relay to trigger (1, 2, 3, or 4).
Each relay number corresponds to a single relay in the kit, as shown in the first diagram.

_Optional:_

Action::
Perform an action on the specified relay, defaults to ToggleOff.
Valid actions include the following:
[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Action     |Description
|ToggleOff  |Sets the relay to the OFF position, then sets the relay to the ON position.
|ToggleOn   |Sets the relay to the ON position, then sets the relay to the OFF position.
|SetOn      |Sets the relay to the ON position.
|SetOff     |Sets the relay to the OFF position.
|==========================================================

StartOnCall::
Toggle power when the specified call is received from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

ToggleDelay::
Pause in milliseconds between off/on, defaults to `500`.
Formerly named OnOffPause.

When::
Specify one of the following values to determine when a relay should be toggled:
+

|==========================================================
|"When" Setting              |Description
|DetectFault                 |
Toggle power when checking for a fault.
This occurs after OnIterationEnd.
|OnStart                     |
Toggle power when the fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |
Toggle power when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Toggle power at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Toggle power at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Toggle power when any monitor detects a fault.
This is the default setting.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Toggle power at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Toggle power when the call specified by the 'StartOnCall' parameter is received from the state model.

.When Choices for Performing an Action

=== Examples

.Reset power on Relay 1 +

This uses the CanaKitRelay monitor to reset relay{nbsp}1,
which toggles the power off,
then back on.
A device attached to this relay will restart when the relay resets.
The default setting for the 'When' parameter is `OnFault`,
so the relay will be toggled after a fault is detected.
