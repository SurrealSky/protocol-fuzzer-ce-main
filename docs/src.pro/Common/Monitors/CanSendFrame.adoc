== CAN Send Frame Monitor

*Monitor Category*: *Automation*

The _CAN Send Frame_ monitor is used to send CAN frames that are not fuzzed.
Frames can be sent at specific points during a test case, every N milliseconds,
or both. This can be useful to simulate messages required by a target.

The CAN frames being sent can share the same driver and channel as the fuzzing, or
use a different driver/channel.

NOTE: The DLC is auto set based on the data size provided.

=== Parameters

_Required:_

CanDriver:: Driver to use. Defaults to 'Vector XL'.
CanChannel:: Channel number
CanBitrate:: Set the bitrate for CAN packet transmission (default 500,000)
Id:: CAN Frame ID field in hex.
Data:: CAN data to transmit in hex.

_Optional:_

SendEvery:: Send frame every N milliseconds. Disable by setting to zero. Defaults to 0.

When::
Specify one of the following values to determine when a CAN frame should be sent (defaults to `OnStart`):

|==========================================================
|"When" Setting              |Description
|DetectFault                 |
Send CAN frame when checking for a fault.
This occurs after OnIterationEnd.
|OnStart                     |
Send CAN frame when the fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |
Send CAN frame when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Send CAN frame at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Send CAN frame at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Send CAN frame when any monitor detects a fault.
This is the default setting.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Send CAN frame at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Send CAN frame when the call specified by the 'StartOnCall' parameter is received from the state model.

StartOnCall::
Send frame when the specified event is received from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.
