== CleanupFolder Monitor

*Monitor Category*: *Automation*

The _CleanupFolder_ monitor provides automated cleanup of files created during a
fuzzing session. This monitor purges files produced during an iteration before
the start of the following iteration. CleanupFolder acts upon a specified directory,
and does not affect any files or directories that predate the fuzzing session.

. The directory, +clean2+, initially contains a single file.
+

. Before each iteration, the CleanupFolder monitor deletes from the specified folder
all files that were generated in the previous fuzzing iteration.
. During each iteration, the File publisher creates a fuzzed file.

. The following image shows the output from a file fuzzing session that uses _CleanupFolder_ on the +clean2+ directory. The session duration is 5 iterations.

. The following image shows the +clean2+ directory with output from a file fuzzing session that does _not_ use _CleanupFolder_, but is otherwise identical to the pit used for the previous diagram. Files generated in the fuzzing session are highlighted.

NOTE: The FilePerIteration publisher, that generates a new filename for each fuzzed file, produced the fuzzed output files for both of the previous images.
