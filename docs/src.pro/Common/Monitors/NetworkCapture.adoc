== NetworkCapture Monitor

*Monitor Categories*: *Data collection*, *Fault detection*

The _NetworkCapture_ monitor performs network captures during the fuzzing iteration.
When a packet arrives,
this monitor writes the content into a file,
increments the received packet count,
and waits for the next packet to arrive.
If a filter is used,
the captured packets and associated packet count are for packets that pass the filtering criteria.

The captured data begins afresh for each iteration.
If a fault occurs,
the captured data is logged as a `.pcap` file and returned with the fault data.
The `.pcap` file is compatible with Wireshark and `tcpdump`.
A sample capture follows:

image::{images}/Common/Monitors/NetworkCapture.png[scalewidth="75%"]

Peach supports multiple _NetworkCapture_ monitors in the same pit,
as well as simple and compound packet filters in a single monitor.
A compound packet filter consists of more than one packet filter joined by AND or OR.

[NOTE]
==================================
A packet filter is a boolean value applied to a packet.
If the result of the operation is true,
the packet is accepted.
If the result is false,
the packet is ignored.

The main benefit of using filters is performance.
Applying a filter to a packet produces a smaller dataset, resulting in faster processing time for each iteration. 

Two strategies for developing effective filters:

. Develop a filter that pinpoints the packets to process.
. Develop a filter that prunes unwanted packets using negative logic.

Generally,
using one monitor with a complex filter is better than using two monitors with simpler filters.
Using one monitor places all the packets in a single file with an order of arrival.
Using multiple monitors makes correlating arrival more difficult because each monitor has its own file to keep the processed packets.

For information on filter strings,
see the following:

* http://www.infosecwriters.com/text_resources/pdf/JStebelton_BPF.pdf[Berkely Packet Filters - The Basics]
* http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html[tcpdump man page]

==================================

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Device::
Device name or port where the packet capture takes place.

[NOTE]
====
The Peach command line option `--showdevices` causes Peach to generate a list of all available network interfaces.

* On Windows platforms, the `ipconfig` utility lists the network devices.
* On Unix platforms, the `ifconfig` utility lists the network devices.
====

_Optional:_

Filter::
PCAP style filter string.
If present,
the filter restricts capture to packets that match the filter string.

=== Examples

ifdef::peachug[]

.Show the network devices from `ipconfig`
====================

This example uses `ipconfig` from the Windows command line to list the available network devices on the
system.
The device names follow:

* Local Area Connection
* Wi-Fi
* Ethernet
* VMware Network Adapter VMnet1
* VMware Network Adapter VMnet8

Type the following command and press ENTER.

.Capture output to CrashableServer on port 4244
====================

This parameter example is from a setup that captures all network traffic using the NetworkCapture monitor when a fault occurs.
When running the fuzzing definition for this example,
a crash occurs after a few iterations.
When Peach logs the fault,
a `.pcap` file is created inside the fault record.

|==========================================================
|Parameter    |Value
|Device       |`Local Area Connection`
|Filter       |`port 4244`
|==========================================================

The setup for this example uses a second monitor,
the xref:Monitors_WindowsDebugger[Windows Debugger] monitor,
to launch the `CrashableServer` executable,
normally located in the Peach directory.
The following table lists the parameters for that monitor.

|Parameter    |Value
|Executable   |`CrashableServer.exe`

.Capture output to CrashableServer on port 4244
==================
This example runs `CrashableServer.exe` and capture all network traffic using the NetworkCapture monitor when a fault occurs.

To run this example,
point to the `CrashableServer` location (normally the Peach directory).

Running this example for a few iterations will produce a crash.
When Peach is logging the fault,
a `.pcap` file is created inside the fault record.
