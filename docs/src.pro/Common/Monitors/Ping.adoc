== Ping Monitor

*Monitor Category*: *Fault detection*

The _Ping_ monitor verifies whether a device is functioning by sending a packet to a target location,
and waiting for a response from the device.
_Ping_ continues to monitor until either a _Timeout_ occurs or a response from the target device reaches the _Ping_ monitor.
Ping runs at the end of each iteration.

In the first scenario (left),
Ping successfully interacts with the test target.

. At the end of each iteration, the Ping monitor sends a message to the test target.
. In this case, the target receives the message and sends a response.
. The monitor waits a specified time period for a response.
In this case,
the response within the time period,
and gives the "OK" response.
The Ping Monitor resets for the sequence to repeat at the end of the next iteration.

In the second scenario (right),
the test target is non-responsive.

. At the end of the iteration, the Ping monitor sends a message to the test target.
. (2B) In this case, the target is non-responsive or no longer exists. No response is sent.
. (3B) The monitor waits a specified time period for a response.
In this case, a timeout occurs.
The Ping monitor issues a fault and collects data around the fault.
Ping resets for the next iteration.

_Ping_ can validate that a target is still up or is waiting to restart.
This is useful when fuzzing embedded devices that crash surreptitiously.

Additionally,
by using the 'FaultOnSuccess' parameter,
_Ping_ can help you to verify whether or not a new device at a specific address becomes available,
or that a non-functioning device starts to function.
For example,
if you are fuzzing a device that programmatically turns other computers on,
you can use _Ping_ with 'FaultOnSuccess' set to `true` to determine whether the computers are off (an uninteresting result) or on (an interesting result).

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host::
Host name or IP address to ping.

_Optional:_

Data::
Data to send in the ping packet payload.
If this value is left blank,
the OS will use default data to send.

FaultOnSuccess::
Fault if ping is successful, defaults to `false`.

Timeout::
Timeout value expressed in milliseconds, defaults to `1000`.
