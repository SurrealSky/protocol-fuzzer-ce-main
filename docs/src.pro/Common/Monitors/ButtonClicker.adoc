== ButtonClicker Monitor

*Monitor Category*: *Automation*

The _ButtonClicker_ monitor provides automation functionality by clicking buttons
in the Windows GUI. This monitor runs in the Windows environment. _ButtonClicker_
watches and clicks the appropriate button within the specified window. You can use
_ButtonClicker_ to click a button in the window, such as "OK" or "Close".

The intent of this monitor is to initiate an action or to close a window to keep a
fuzzing session active. _Buttonclicker_ runs from the beginning of a fuzzing session
to the end of the session.

The following example uses an FTP client, FileZilla, that sometimes opens a popup window
asking whether to install an update. Here, _ButtonClicker_ monitor provides a mouse
click to the "Close" button to close the popup window. With the popup window out of
the way, fuzzing continues without delay.

NOTE: Another monitor to consider for watching popup windows is
xref:Monitors_PopupWatcher[PopupWatcher], that can monitor several popup windows.

=== Parameters

_Required:_

WindowText:: Text from the window title that identifies the window to receive the button
click. The text string can be part or all of the window title.

ButtonName:: Text label of the button to click. The label is displayed to the user,
and is on or near the button that will receive the click.

_Optional:_

None.

[TIP]
====
If Peach has trouble clicking a button, the button might have a link to a shortcut key.

The shortcut key is displayed in the label using an underlined character. Windows does
this by inserting an ampersand "&" immediately before the shortcut key within the button
label. Further, not all underlining shows in the initial display of the window.

In an application, you can manually force underlining to display in window buttons by
pressing the <CTRL> or <ALT> key. Once you find the underlining in the application,
you can adjust the value of the +ButtonName+ parameter for _ButtonClick_ by inserting
an ampersand (&) immediately before any underlined character. Then, Peach will find the
button to click.

For example, in Microsoft Word, the Browsing dialog box used to open a document does
not immediately display underlining in its command buttons. You can see this by following
the sequence that opens a file:

. Click *File* on the ribbon.
. Click *Open* on the vertical menu.
. Click *Computer* in the Open column.
. Click the *Browse* button. +
The dialog opens and the "Open" button in the lower right corner is not underlined. Press the <ALT> or <CTRL> key to see the underlining as in the following illustration.
