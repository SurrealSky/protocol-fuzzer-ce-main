== CAN Timing Monitor

*Monitor Category*: *Fault detection*

The _CAN Timing_ monitor is will trigger a fault when a frame is not received within a specified time window.
Many CAN targets are designed to send one or more CAN frames every N milliseconds.
When transmition of these frames stops or is out of spec, this can indicate a failure in the target device.

The CAN frames being sent can share the same driver and channel as the fuzzing, or use a different driver/channel.

=== Parameters

_Required:_

CanDriver:: Driver to use. Defaults to 'Vector XL'.
CanChannel:: Channel number
CanBitrate:: Set the bitrate for CAN packet reception (default 500,000)
Id:: CAN Frame ID field in hex to expect
Window::
Reception window (how often frame should be received) in milliseconds.
If frame with `Id` is not received in this window of time, a fault will be raised.

_Optional:_

///////////////////////////////
When::
Specify one of the following values to determine when a CAN frame should be sent (defaults to `OnStart`):

|==========================================================
|"When" Setting              |Description
|DetectFault                 |
Start receiving when checking for a fault.
This occurs after OnIterationEnd.
|OnStart                     |
Start receiving when the fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |
Start receiving when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Start receiving at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Start receiving at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Start receiving when any monitor detects a fault.
This is the default setting.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Start receiving at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Start receiving when the call specified by the 'StartOnCall' parameter is received from the state model.

StartOnCall::
Start receiving when the specified event is received from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

.Expect frame every half second +

==============================
This parameter example is from a setup that uses the CAN Timing Monitor
to fault if a specific CAN frame is not received every half second.
