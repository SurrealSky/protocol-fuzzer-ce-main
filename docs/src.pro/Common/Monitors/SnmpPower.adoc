== SNMP Power Monitor

*Monitor Categories*: *Automation*

The _SNMP Power_ monitor switches outlets on a power distribution unit (PDU) on and off via SNMPv1.
This monitor is useful for automatically power cycling devices during a fuzzing session.

Each _SNMP Power_ monitor switches one or more of a PDU's outlets, according to the configuration.
All affected outlets are given the same commands, so turning some outlets on and others off would require another monitor.
The monitor can reset the power outlets at the following points in time:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault
* When a specified call is received from the state model

TIP: The xref:Monitors_IpPower9258[IpPower9258 Monitor] and
xref:Monitors_ApcPower[ApcPower Monitor] provide similar features, for
IP Power 9258 and APC devices, respectively. For controlling power to
a device by wiring through a relay, Peach provides a monitor for the
xref:Monitors_CanaKitRelay[CanaKit 4-Port USB Relay Controller].

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host::
IP address of the switched power distribution unit.

OIDs::
Comma-separated list of OIDs for controlling the power outlets.
To determine the OIDs, start by installing the SNMP MIB provided by the device manufacturer.
Use a utility like `snmptranslate` to lookup numeric OID associate with the OID name of an outlet.
For example, `snmptranslate -On PowerNet-MIB::sPDUOutletCtl.1` indicates `.1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.4.4.2.1.3.1` is the OID to use for outlet 1 on an APC Switched Power Distribution Unit (AC7900).


_Optional:_

OnCode::
On indicator code used by outlet OIDs. Default is `1`.

OffCode::
Off indicator code used by outlet OIDs. Default is `2`.

Port::
SNMP port on the switched power distribution unit. Default is `161`.

ReadCommunity::
SNMP community string to use when reading the state of the outlets. Default is `public`.

WriteCommunity::
SNMP community string to use when modifying the state of the outlets. Default is `private`.

RequestTimeout::
Maximum duration in millseconds to block when sending an SNMP request to the PDU. Default is `1000`.

SanityCheckOnStart::
On startup, ensure switch state changes persist. Default is `true`.

SanityCheckWaitTimeout::
Maximum duration to wait for state change to take effect during startup sanity check. Default is `3000`.

ResetOnCall::
Reset power when the specified call is received from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

PowerOffOnEnd::
Power off when the fuzzing session completes, default is `false`.

PowerOnOffPause::
Pause in milliseconds between power off/power on, default is `500`.

When::
When to reset power on the specified outlets. Default is `OnFault`.

|"When" Setting              |Description
|DetectFault                 |
Reset power when checking for a fault.
This occurs after OnIterationEnd.
|OnStart                     |
Reset power when the fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |
Reset power when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Reset power at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Reset power at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Reset power when any monitor detects a fault.
This is the default setting.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Reset power at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Reset power when the call specified by the 'ResetOnCall' parameter is received from the state model.
