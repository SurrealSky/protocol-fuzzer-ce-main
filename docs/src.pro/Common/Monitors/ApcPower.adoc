== APC Power Monitor

*Monitor Categories*: *Automation*

The _APC Power_ monitor switches outlets on an APC power distribution unit (PDU) on and off via SNMPv1.
This monitor is useful for automatically power cycling devices during a fuzzing session.
APC's Switched Rack Power Distribution Unit (AC7900) is known to work with this monitor.

Each _APC Power_ monitor switches one or more of a PDU's outlets, according to the configuration.
All affected outlets are given the same commands, so turning some outlets on and others off would require another monitor.
The monitor can reset the power outlets at the following points in time:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault
* When a specified call is received from the state model

TIP: The xref:Monitors_IpPower9258[IpPower9258 Monitor] provides
 similar features, specific to the IP Power 9258 devices. The
 xref:Monitors_SnmpPower[SnmpPower Monitor] is designed to work with
 non-APC PDUs that can be controlled via SNMPv1. For controlling power
 to a device by wiring through a relay, Peach provides a monitor for
 the xref:Monitors_CanaKitRelay[CanaKit 4-Port USB Relay Controller].

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host::
IP address of the switched power distribution unit.

OutletGrouping::
Whether outlets on the PDU are identified individually (`Outlet`) or in groups (`OutletGroup`). Default is `Outlet`.

Outlets::
Comma-separated list of numeric identifiers for outlets or outlet groups to control.


_Optional:_

Port::
SNMP port on the switched power distribution unit. Default is `161`.

ReadCommunity::
SNMP community string to use when reading the state of the outlets. Default is `public`.

WriteCommunity::
SNMP community string to use when modifying the state of the outlets. Default is `private`.

RequestTimeout::
Maximum duration in millseconds to block when sending an SNMP request to the PDU. Default is `1000`.

SanityCheckOnStart::
On startup, ensure switch state changes persist. Default is `true`.

SanityCheckWaitTimeout::
Maximum duration to wait for state change to take effect during startup sanity check. Default is `3000`.

ResetOnCall::
Reset power when the specified call is received from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

PowerOffOnEnd::
Power off when the fuzzing session completes, default is `false`.

PowerOnOffPause::
Pause in milliseconds between power off/power on, default is `500`.

When::
When to reset power on the specified outlets or outlet groups. Default is `OnFault`.

Reset power when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Reset power at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Reset power at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Reset power when any monitor detects a fault.
This is the default setting.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Reset power at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Reset power when the call specified by the 'ResetOnCall' parameter is received from the state model.
