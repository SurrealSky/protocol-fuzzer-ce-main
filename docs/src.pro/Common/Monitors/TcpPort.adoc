== TcpPort Monitor

*Monitor Categories*: *Automation*, *Data collection*, *Fault detection*

The _TcpPort_ monitor detects state changes on TCP ports.
A state change is a transition in port status from 'Open' to 'Closed' or from 'Closed' to 'Open'.
The _TcpPort_ monitor can be configured in the following ways:

* as an automation task (wait until a specified state occurs)
* fault detection (fault on a specific state)
* data collection (report the current state)

For automation tasks,
the _When_ parameter can be configured to detect the state of a TCP port
at various points in time during a fuzzing session:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault
* When a specified call is received from the state model

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host::
Hostname or IP address of the remote host

Port::
Port number to monitor

_Optional:_

Action::
Action to take (Automation, Data, Fault).
Defaults to `Automation`.
+
[horizontal]
Automation;; Wait for the port to reach a specified state.
The _When_ parameter determines when the monitor should detect the state of the specified port.
Data;; Report the state of the port immediately following a fault that is detected by any other monitor.
Fault;; Generate a fault if the port is in a specified state at the end of an iteration.
[vertical]

State::
Port state to monitor.
The default value is `Open`.
+
[horizontal]
Open;; The port is available for use.
Closed;; The port is not available.
[vertical]

Timeout::
The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the specified TCP state to occur.
Specify `-1` to indicate an infinte timeout.

WaitOnCall::
Detect port state upon recept of the specified call from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

When::
+
Specify one of the following values to control when port state detection should occur during a fuzzing session:

|==========================================================
|"When" Setting              |Description
|OnStart                     |
Detect port state when the fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |
Detect port state when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Detect port state at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Detect port state at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Detect port state when any monitor detects a fault.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Detect port state at the start of the iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Detect port state upon receipt of the call specified by the 'WaitOnCall' parameter from the state model.
This is the default setting.

=== Examples

ifdef::peachug[]

.Automation example: Open
====================
This example causes Peach to wait until the remote port is in an open state after the `WaitForPort` call is received from the state model.
No timeout interval is provided, so Peach will wait forever.

[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Parameter    |Value
|Host         |`192.168.133.4`
|Port         |`502`
|WaitOnCall   |`WaitForPort`
|==========================================================
====================

.Automation example: Closed
====================
This example causes Peach to wait until the remote port in in a closed state after the `WaitForPort` call is received from the state model.
No timeout interval is provided, so Peach will wait forever.

[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Parameter    |Value
|Host         |`192.168.133.4`
|Port         |`502`
|State        |`Closed`
|WaitOnCall   |`WaitForPort`
|==========================================================
====================

.Fault Detection example
====================
This example inspects the state of the remote port at the end of an iteration.
A fault is generated if the port is closed at the end of an iteration.

[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Parameter    |Value
|Host         |`192.168.133.4`
|Port         |`502`
|Action       |`Fault`
|State        |`Closed`
|==========================================================
====================

.Data Collection example
====================

This example causes the TcpPort monitor to report the state of a port after a fault is detected by any other monitor.

[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Parameter    |Value
|Host         |`192.168.133.4`
|Port         |`502`
|Action       |`Data`
|==========================================================
