== CleanupRegistry Monitor (Windows)

*Monitor Category*: *Automation*

The _CleanupRegistry_ monitor provides automated cleanup of Windows registry
entries created during a fuzzing session. Cleanup occurs before every iteration.

This monitor uses a specified registry key (a parent key) as a reference point
and deletes all child keys or descendants of the parent key. All child keys at
all levels beneath the parent key are removed. Values attached to child keys are
removed as well.

Optionally, _CleanupRegistry_ can include or exclude the parent key and values
attached to the parent key in its purge.

[NOTE]
====
The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores information about
the computer system, configuration, applications, current user settings, and
performance data. The contents and use of the registry has evolved since its
inception. Originally, the registry stored installation and initialization
settings for applications. On current versions of Windows, the registry contains
information for the current user, and much more, such as a list of external
serial ports that the machine has allocated.

One common use of the registry is to store a list of the most recently used
files used in an application. This list is typically displayed to a user to
improve the experience of selecting a file for the application to open.

The Windows registry consists of five hierarchies called hives, as shown in
the following illustration. Each hive consists of keys and values.

* A key is a container that can contain other keys and values. A key has a name,
a type, and optionally, a data value. The following illustration shows a selected
key. The complete name for this key is reported in the lower left corner.
* A value is an item associated with a key that has a type, a data value, and
optionally, a name. In the following illustration, the named values defined for the
selected key are listed in the right side of the window.

Each hive has one root key that is the entry point to the hive. These root keys
are the prefixes described for the _CleanupRegistry_ `Key` parameter. The hives
used most often are `HKCU` and `HKLM`, but keys from other hives are accessible as well.

Locating a key in the registry is similar to locating a folder on disk. Start with
the root key and specify the sequence of keys you need to reach the desired key.
Separate keys with the back slash character "\", just like the folders in a path.

A root key, such as `HKCU,` has child keys; that is, the keys that it contains.
A non-root key, such as `HKCU\Software`, has a parent key (`HKCU`) and, optionally,
child keys. Note that `HKCU` is the parent key of `Software`. The key
`HKCU\Software\Mozilla\FireFox` also has two child keys or children (`Crash Reporter` and `TaskBarIDs`).

bibliography, which can serve as a foundation for additional reading. Also, the
Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) has several articles on the registry.

[TIP]
====
In _CleanupRegistry_, you do not have control over individual values. You simply
identify the parent key, and specify whether you need to zap the parent key;
then let the monitor clean up around that registry key after each iteration.

Sometimes, applications keep lists of recently used files in the registry, typically
in the HKCU or HKLM hives. If you receive an error about not being able to create
a key in the registry, you might need to clear the children of a specified key.

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Key::
	Registry key to remove. The following *key prefixes* are used:  +
    *HKCU* - Current user  +
	*HKCC* - Current configuration  +
	*HKLM* - Local machine  +
	*HKPD* - Performance data  +
	*HKU* - Users

_Optional:_

ChildrenOnly:: If true, omits the parent key from the purge, thereby deleting
all descendants (sub-keys) of the specified key. +
If false, the parent key and all descendants are deleted. Defaults to false.

=== Examples

ifdef::peachug[]

.Cleanup for Office +
This parameter example is from a setup that uses the CleanupRegistry monitor to remove a specified key from the Windows Registry.

==================================================

[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Parameter    |Value
|Key          |`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Office13\Recovery`

The following image shows the portion of the registry that contains the key to delete.

This monitor deleted the key. The following image shows the same area of the registry after fuzzing and using the CleanupRegistry monitor.

.Cleanup for office +
This uses the CleanupRegistry monitor to remove a specified key from the Windows Registry at the beginning of a fuzzing session as part of the control iteration.
