== SshCommand Monitor

*Monitor Categories*: *Automation*, *Data collection*, *Fault detection*

The _SshCommand_ monitor connects to a remote host over SSH (Secure Shell),
runs a command,
and waits for the command to complete.
The output from the process is logged when a fault is detected.
This monitor can operate as a fault detector,
data collector,
and automation module depending on configuration.

_SshCommand_ supports password, keyboard, and private key authentication methods.

To increase the speed of operation,
the monitor holds open the SSH connection to the remote machine across test iterations.
This removes the cost of authenticating every time the command is executed.
If multiple _SshCommand_ monitors are configured against the same remote host,
multiple SSH connections are created and held open.

*Fault Detection*

This monitor can perform fault detection depending on the configuration of the 'FaultOnMatch' and 'CheckValue' parameters.
The following table describes the behavior of these parameters:
[options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|FaultOnMatch      | CheckValue match  | Behavior
|`true`            | yes               | Fault detection
|`true`            | no                | Data collection
|`false`           | yes               | Data collection
|`false`           | no                | Fault detection
|==========================================================

This monitor will also automatically detect link:https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer[AddressSanitizer] crash information and generate a fault if found.

*Data Collection*

The monitor always collects the output from the executed command and reports it for logging when a fault is detected.

*Automation*

The _SshCommand_ monitor can run the specified command at various points in time during a fuzzing session:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* While detecting a fault
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault
* When a specified call is received from the state model

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host::
Remote hostname or IP address for the SSH connection.

Username::
Username for authentication with the remote host.

Command::
The command to execute on the remote host.

_Optional:_

Password::
Password for authentication with the remote host.
Defaults to `""`.
Either the 'Password' or the 'KeyPath' parameter must be set.

KeyPath::
A local path to the private part of an SSH key-pair to be used for authentication with the remote host.
Defaults to `""`.
Either the 'Password' or the 'KeyPath' parameter must be set.

CheckValue::
A regular expression to match the command output.
Defaults to `""`.

FaultOnMatch::
Trigger a fault if 'FaultOnMatch' is `true` and the 'CheckValue' regular expression matches,
or 'FaultOnMatch' is `false` and the 'CheckValue' regular expression does not match.
Defaults to `false`.

StartOnCall::
Run the specified command after the monitor receives the specified call from the state machine.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

When::
+
Specify one of the following values to determine when to run the specified command:

|==========================================================
|'When' Value                 |Description
|+DetectFault+                |
Run the command to perform fault detection.
Requires a regular expression to be specified in the 'CheckValue' parameter.
This is the default setting.
|+OnStart+                    |
Run the command when fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|+OnEnd+                      |
Run the command when fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|+OnIterationStart+           |
Run the command at the start of each iteration.
|+OnIterationEnd+             |
Run the command at the end of each iteration.
|+OnFault+                    |
Run the command when any monitor detects a fault.
|+OnIterationStartAfterFault+ |
Run the command at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|+OnCall+                     |
Run the command upon receipt of the call specified by the 'WaitOnCall' parameter from the state model.

.Fault Detection example
====================
This example connects to the target machine using SSH during the fault detection phase of a test iteration.
A fault occurs if any core files exist.

|Command       |`ls /var/cores/*.core`
|CheckValue    |`target.*?.core`
|FaultOnMatch  |`true`
