== IpPower9258 Monitor

*Monitor Category*: *Automation*

The _IpPower9258_ monitor controls an IP Power 9258 Network Power Controller (IP9258).
The IP9258 consists of four three-prong outlets that support electrical loads of 6 amps at 110 or 240 VAC.
Communications between Peach and the IP9258 uses Ethernet cabling.
This monitor allows devices plugged into the IP Power 9258 switch to be powered on/off during fuzzing.

Each _IpPower9258_ monitor switches an individual outlet.
Use one monitor per outlet to control multiple outlets concurrently.
The monitor can toggle power on an outlet at the following points in time:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* During the detection of a fault
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault
* When a specified call is received from the state model

TIP: Peach also supports power distribution units that can be
controlled using SNMPv1. For APC PDUs use the
xref:Monitors_ApcPower[APC Power Monitor], and for others try the
xref:Monitors_SnmpPower[SNMP Power Monitor]. To control power to a
device by wiring through a relay, Peach provides the
xref:Monitors_CanaKitRelay[CanaKit 4-Port USB Relay Monitor].

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host::
Host or IP address (can include HTTP interface port e.g. :8080)

Port::
Port/Outlet to reset (1, 2, 3, 4)

User::
Username to be used when connecting to the IP Power 9258 device.

Password::
Password to be used when connecting to the IP Power 9258 device.

_Optional:_

StartOnCall::
Toggle power when the specified call is received from the state model.
This value is used only when the 'When' parameter is set to `OnCall`.

PowerOnOffPause::
Pause in milliseconds between power off/power on, default is `500`.

PowerOffOnEnd::
Power off when the fuzzing session completes, default is `false`.

When::
Specify one of the following values to determine when a port should be toggled:

|"When" Setting              |Description
|DetectFault                 |
Toggle power when checking for a fault.
This occurs after OnIterationEnd.
|OnStart                     |
Toggle power when the fuzzing session starts.
This occurs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |
Toggle power when the fuzzing session stops.
This occurs once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |
Toggle power at the start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |
Toggle power at the end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |
Toggle power when any monitor detects a fault.
This is the default setting.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |
Toggle power at the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |
Toggle power when the call specified by the 'StartOnCall' parameter is received from the state model.

.Catch crashes from Movie Player +
====================

This parameter example is from a setup that controls port 1 of a IP Power 9258 Network Power Controller.
After a fault is detected,
the monitor toggles the power on port 1.
