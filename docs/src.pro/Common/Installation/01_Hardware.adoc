=== Hardware Requirements

The following are generic hardware recommendations. Adjust based on your needs.

==== Local Target

When fuzzing a local target (software running on the same machine as Peach),
additional resources are required for the target process.

|========
| Target Type | Architecture | Cores | Ram  | Disk
| Network     | 64-bit       | 4     | 8GB  | 60GB SSD
| File        | 64-bit       | 4     | 16GB | 60GB SSD
| Other       | 64-bit       | 4     | 8GB  | 60GB SSD
|========

==== Remote Target

Remote target fuzzing occurs when the target is not located on the machine running Peach.

[options="header"]
|========
|             | Architecture  | Cores | Ram  | Disk
| Minimum     | 64-bit        | 2     | 4GB  | 60GB Any
| Recommended | 64-bit        | 2     | 8GB  | 60GB SSD
|========

TIP: It's possible to run Peach on 32-bit systems, 
but it's not recommended as it places severe limits on memory usage (max 2GB).
