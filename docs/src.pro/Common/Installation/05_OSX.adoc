[[InstallOnOSX]]
=== macOS

To install on macOS, follow the installation steps provided below.  Installation will require installing the Mono .NET runtime, then Peach.
To enable support for the xref:Monitors_CrashWrangler[CrashWrangler] monitor,
install CrashWrangler and Xcode.
Note that installing CrashWrangler is optional;
it is only needed when running the target locally.

[NOTE]
====
Peach Fuzzer, LLC,
recommends using Mono .NET runtime version 4.8.1 from the mono project.

Peach will not run with Mono version 5.0 or newer due to incompatibilities with our Python runtime.
If you have Mono 5.0 installed, you must downgrade to 4.8.1.

Peach will not run with version 4.4 of the Mono runtime as there are known
handle leaks which can cause Peach to run out of memory during long fuzzing runs.
If you have Mono 4.4 installed, you can either upgrade to 4.6+ or downgrade to 4.2.

. Install the https://download.mono-project.com/archive/4.8.1/macos-10-universal/[Mono package].

The file is a zip file with the extension `.zip`.
