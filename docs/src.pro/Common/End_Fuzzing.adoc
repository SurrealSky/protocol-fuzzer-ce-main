[[Fuzzing_ExitCriteria]]
=== When to Stop Fuzzing

A fuzzing bar sets requirements for a fuzzing job and answers the question, “How long do we fuzz?”

Here is one set of exiting criteria that consists of two requirements:

* The fuzzer must run a set number of test cases. +
The number of test cases performed must meet or exceed the specified threshold.
* The fuzzer must have at least Y consecutive clean test cases. +
A clean test case generates zero new faults.

As soon as both requirements occur, fuzzing can stop.

For example, when fuzzing a new product, the release criteria might be set to 250,000 total fuzzing test cases on the product and yield 150,000 consecutive clean test cases.

The following diagram shows one way of meeting this criteria and focuses on the number of test cases performed, test case failures, and the number of consecutive clean test cases.

A few items are worth noting:

* The total number of test cases performed is 250K.
* The number of consecutive clean test cases is 200K, surpassing the requirement of
150K clean test cases. The last 50K test cases were needed to meet the first requirement.
* The count of consecutive clean test cases reset to zero when a new fault was found at the 50,000th test case.

The next diagram shows another way of meeting this criteria.

Again, a few of items are worth noting:

* The total number of test cases performed is 450K.
* The number of consecutive clean test cases is 150K.
* The count of the consecutive clean test cases restarted three times due to
new faults occurring in test cases: after 76K, 200K, and 300K.

The requirements used in the previous example are reasonable for a first release of a product. However, each successive version of a product should become more and more stable. This can be realized by increasing the total number of test cases performed by the fuzzer, and the number of consecutive clean test cases that result from fuzzing. The following table provides increasing requirements as a product matures.

Verification Phase. Peach Fuzzer can operate on non-executable file formats,
