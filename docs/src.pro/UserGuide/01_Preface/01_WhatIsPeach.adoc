=== What is {product}?

{product} (Peach) is a fuzzer for data consumers. Fuzzing is a software testing technique that
introduces malformed data to parts of a computer system. How the tested item reacts to unexpected
data becomes the source of security bugs.

Peach is a smart fuzzer that operates by performing the following actions:

* Understands the data structure and the flows of the test target
* Creates and feeds malformed data to the test target
* Monitors the test target to record interesting information when unintended or undesirable behavior
occurs (monitors include debuggers and network packet sniffers)

Peach is a versatile product and has been used to fuzz a wide range of products and devices:

* web browsers (file consumers)
* web servers (network servers)
* mobile devices (such as Android iOS)
* robots
* SCADA systems
* Semiconductor chips

Because Peach can easily extend its interfacing and monitoring, it is the most adaptable fuzzer that exists.
