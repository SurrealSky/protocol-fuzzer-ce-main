== Monitoring Recipes

Peach Fuzzer has very powerful monitoring capabilities that detect faults that occur in the test
target, collect data surrounding each fault, and automate the test
environment. This section provides some suggested monitoring configurations for
different types of targets. These recipes can be used as-is or as
starting points for a custom configurations.

All of the recipes here follow a common process:

1.	Define the workflow for the fuzzing session.
2.	Define the Peach components to use in configuring the fuzzing setup.
This step focuses on the monitoring needs and the agents that house the monitors.
3.	Provide configuration settings used to fuzz a sample test target using the recipe.

[NOTE]
=======
*NOTE*: Assumptions/Givens in each recipe include the following:

* A Pit, pre-defined or custom, is ready to use.
* Peach is installed and ready to run.
* All software modules needed to perform the fuzzing job are available for use.
=======

*What's left to do?* +
When you finish developing a recipe, it's time to fill out and test the
configuration, then run the fuzzing job.

* See the xref:JumpStart[Getting Started with the Peach Fuzzer Platform] for the workflow to run a fuzzing job.
