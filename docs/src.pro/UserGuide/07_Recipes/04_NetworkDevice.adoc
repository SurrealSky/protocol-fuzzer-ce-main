=== Recipe: Monitoring a Network Device

This recipe identifies the monitors and associated settings suitable for testing a
network device, such as a router or a switch. The network device connects to the
computer running Peach via a network interface. Peach tests the connection using
a specific protocol or service. The network device's serial console connects
to the computer running Peach. Peach uses the serial console to capture and inspect
device messages.

This recipe uses a router to demonstrate the procedure.

NOTE: When testing protocols in layers 2 through 4 of the ISO network model,
consider using a private test network so that the testing doesn't affect other
systems on the network.


==== What is the fuzzing session workflow?

The workflow that we want to follow in the test consists of the following steps:

.	Power on the device.
.	Wait for the device to complete its boot process.
.	Fuzz the device and look for faults.
.	When a fault occurs, do the following:
..	Reset the device by cycling the power off and then on.
..	Wait for the device to complete its boot process.
.	Loop to step 3 and continue fuzzing.

Given this, here's a diagram of connections for the test configuration.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_Overview.png[scale="50"]

Peach handles communications with the device using a single, local agent. Peach also
connects to a programmable power supply, the IpPower 9258, that can be powered down
and up on command. In step 4a of the workflow, Peach sends the power cycling command
to the IpPower 9258 to perform this task.

Now for setting up the monitors, consisting of detecting faults, collecting data, and
automating the test environment.

The first item in detecting faults is to ensure the service is still listening
for incoming connections. With more sophisticated devices, a service can stop,
but the device still responds. Use the TCP port monitor for detecting when the service
stops. As a backup, the Ping monitor can be used.

The second item in detecting faults is watching the device console for error messages.
The Serial monitor with a regular expression specified, such as “Error”,
can perform this task. You will need to construct the regular expression to watch
for key word(s) in the error message text because the messages vary among manufacturers. Consult the device documentation or an
expert on the test device for the message content.

When a fault occurs, we want to collect data relevant to the fault. The
NetworkCapture monitor (InterestingPackets) provides the mechanism to capture network packets around the
time that the fault occurs. The Serial monitor provides console logs with messages
leading up to the fault.

Finally, we want to automatically reset the device after a fault occurs by cycling
the power off, then on again. The IpPower9258 monitor provides control over outlets.
A second aspect of automation is that the system must wait for the device reboot
to complete before resuming fuzzing activities. The Serial monitor performs this
task by watching logging messages for a message that indicates the boot process
completed.

==== Setting up Monitors Using the Peach Web UI

===== Starting Peach

. Launch Peach from the command line (type `peach` and press the Return key) to start the UI.
. Select a pit (test definition) of a protocol supported by the network device, so that Peach can communicate with the device during fuzzing.
* Give the pit a name and a description. Peach makes a configuration file of the selections you make, so that you can re-use the setup again.
. From the configuration menu along the left edge of the window, select Monitoring.
. Fill in a name for the agent. Since this agent resides within Peach, the default
location `local` is appropriate. Then, click the`Save` button.

===== Supplying Monitor Details

Begin each monitor with a name or descriptive text. This helps identify one monitor from
another, and is especially evident with the two serial monitors.

Next, fill in the critical parameters for each monitor. These parameters have callouts in
the settings diagram of each monitor. Details for these parameters are given in the text
that follows.

NOTE: The order of the monitors listed in the agent is significant. Peach processes
the monitors in the order listed (from top to bottom). For example, if the IpPower
monitor were last on the list, a blocking situation might arise because one of the
Serial monitors would be waiting for the device boot process to finish before the power
is recycled to initiate the device boot process.

For this recipe, use the monitors in the order they are presented:

* IpPower9258 (BootDevice)
* IpPower9258 (RebootDevice)
* SerialPort (WaitforBootOnStartAndFault)
* SerialPort (WaitForBootAfterFault)
* TcpPort (VerifyDeviceAlive)
* NetworkCapture (InterestingPackets)

===== IpPower9258 (BootDevice)

The xref:Monitors_IpPower9258[IpPower 9258 Monitor] controls the IpPower 9258 device to start the network device at the beginning of the fuzzing session.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_IpPower9258_Boot.png[scale="50"]
h
The *Port* parameter identifies the receptacle of the IpPower9258 device. Numbers range
from 1 to 4. Receptacle 1 is the leftmost receptacle.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_IpPower9258_RearPanel.png[scale="50"]

The *When* parameter "OnStart" identifies that the power cycle occurs at the start of
the fuzzing session.

===== IpPower9258 (RebootDevice)

The second xref:Monitors_IpPower9258[IpPower 9258 Monitor] controls the IpPower 9258 device to recycle power, ensuring that the network device starts in a clean state following a fault.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_IpPower9258_Reboot.png[scale="50"]

The *Port* parameter identifies the receptacle of the IpPower9258 device. Numbers range from 1 to 4. Receptacle 1 is the leftmost receptacle.

The *When* parameter "OnIterationStartAfterFault" identifies that the the power cycle occurs at the start of the test case that immediately follows a fault.

===== Serial Port (WaitforBootOnStartAndFault)

This xref:Monitors_Serial[Serial Port Monitor] addresses two configuration settings:
one automation setting and one fault detection setting. The automation setting causes
Peach to wait for the device to complete its boot processing before starting the
fuzzing session. The fault detection setting causes peach to monitor the console
for messages that indicate a fault occurred on the device.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_Serial_OnStart.png[scale="50"]

The *Port* parameter identifies the serial port on the computer that receives monitoring.

* In Windows, the port map is accessible from the Device Manager located in the
Control Panel\System applet. In the illustration, the value is `COM1`.
* In Linux and OS X systems the port map is accessible with the following command:
`dmesg | grep tty`. Specify the value of the appropriate port, such as `tty0`.

The *Fault Regex* `(CRITICAL | ERROR | ASSERT | CRASH)` identifies words that indicate
a fault occurred. When the monitor encounters any word of a message that matches any word
in the regular expression, Peach issues a fault.

The *Wait When* and *Wait Regex* parameters are automation oriented. *Wait When* identifies
when peach should enter a waiting state. The value `OnStart` identifies that the waiting
period is when the test target goes through the boot process at the beginning of
the fuzzing session. The *Wait Regex* identifies the message text that the monitor looks
to match. Here, the value is `Bootup Completed`. Peach waits until this message appears
to begin fuzzing the target.

NOTE: The regular expressions used with this monitor are used to identify faults
that have occurred in the device. You will need to construct the regular expression
to watch for key word(s) in the error message text. Consult the device documentation
or an expert of the test device for the message content.

===== Serial Port Monitor (WaitForBootAfterFault)
This second instance of the xref:Monitors_Serial[Serial Port Monitor] addresses
resumption of a fuzzing session after a fault.

When a fault occurs, the IpPower9258 recycles the power causing the network device to
reboot. Then, this monitor causes Peach to wait until the network device completes its
boot process and becomes available for use before resuming the current fuzzing session.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_Serial_AfterFault.png[scale="50"]

The *Port* parameter identifies the serial port on the computer that receives monitoring.
Since only one serial port is in this fuzzing setup, the value should be identical with
the value for the WaitforBootOnStartAndFault monitor.

The *Wait When* and *Wait Regex* parameters identify when Peach should enter a waiting
state. The *Wait When* value `OnIterationStartAfterFault` identifies that the waiting
period follows each fault occurrence. The *Wait Regex* identifies the message text that
the monitor looks to match. Here, the value is `Bootup Completed`. Peach waits until
this message appears to resume the fuzzing session in progress.

NOTE: The regular expressions used with this monitor are used to identify conditions
that have occurred in the device. You will need to construct the regular expression
to watch for key word(s) in the error message text. Consult the device documentation
or an expert of the test device for the message content.

===== TcpPort (VerifyDeviceAlive)
The xref:Monitors_TcpPort[TcpPort Monitor] periodically checks two things when the
State Model issues a `Call` event during a test case:

. The state of a TCP port on the target.
. The state of the service or protocol on the target, that uses the same TCP port
on the target.

If the status of the port is `Closed`, Peach reports an error.

TIP: The TcpPort monitor can be used when the target runs TCP. When testing other
protocols,  use the Ping monitor instead to see whether the device as a whole
is responding.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_TcpPort.png[scale="50"]

The *Host* parameter specifies the hostname of the target or the IPv4 address of the
target. The `##TargetIPv4##` value is a configuration variable that you set to identify
the target. Its operation is similar to operating system environment variables.
For more information, see Variables.

The *Port* value should be set to the appropriate port number of the target device
used by the service under test. In this example, the service is using TCP on port 80
of the network device.

For example, some common port values follow: HTTP uses port 80; SSH uses port 22; and,
FTP uses port 21.

The *Action* parameter specifies the type of action that the monitor performs. Here,
the value used is `Fault`;  and causes the monitor to report a fault when the TCP
port is closed and unresponsive.

The *State* parameter specifies the fault condition. The value `Closed` indicates a
fault occurs when the communication channel changes to `Closed`.

===== NetworkCapture (InterestingPackets)
The xref:Monitors_NetworkCapture[NetworkCapture Monitor] captures network traffic (packets) sent and
received from the test target.

image::{images}/UserGuide/Recipes/NetworkDevice_NetworkCapture.png[scale="50"]

The *Device* parameter specifies the hostname of the target or the IPv4 address of the
target. The value given is `eth0`.

The *Filter* parameter is a capture filter (Berkeley Packet Syntax filter used by
Libpcap) that limits the network packets under consideration to those packets that
match the specified filter. The packets that match the filter are captured from the
wire as they arrive or leave the test target.

Here, the the filter consists of the hostname combined with the TCP port number of
the test target. As previously mentioned, `port 80` is the test target TCP port number.

TIP: WireShark refers to the Libpcap filters as capture filters. Use the capture
filters. Wireshark also defines its own display filters that it uses to filter
entries in its session files. The display filters are not compatible with Libpcap.
