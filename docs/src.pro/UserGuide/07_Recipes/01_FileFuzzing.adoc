=== Recipe: Monitoring a File Consumer (File Fuzzing)

This recipe identifies the monitors and associated settings suitable for testing a
file consumer. When fuzzing a file consumer, Peach creates malformed data files,
and then has the file consumer open and access the data from the malformed files.

TIP: Using one common approach, Peach can fuzz file consumers of all types, whether
the file types are multimedia--sound, images, or video; documents--word processing,
text, or presentation; or other types of files, such as archive or compressed data
files.

==== What is the fuzzing session workflow?

The workflow that we want to follow in the test consists of the following steps:

. Perform Fuzzing.
.. Write a file to disk that contains fuzzed data.
.. Run the target application.
.. Wait for the target to consume the data file.
.. Check for faults.
.. If a fault occurs, collect data.
. Repeat step 1.

The monitoring setup for this recipe is simple because a single monitor, the Windows
Debugger monitor, provides most of the functionality needed, including: fault detection,
data collection, and automation.

A second monitor, the PageHeap monitor, enables debug memory allocation settings for
the target process. PageHeap can improve the likelihood that certain types of issues,
such as buffer overflow, will cause the the target to crash. Using the debug memory
allocation settings normally leads to finding more faults during testing.

Here's a diagram of connections for the test configuration.

==== Setting up Monitors Using the Peach Web UI

===== Starting Peach

. Start a Windows command line session with administrative privileges. +
Right-click on the command  prompt on the Windows menu to find the "As Administrator"
setting. PageHeap requires administrative (heightened) privileges.
. Launch Peach from the command line (type `peach` and press the Return key) to start the UI.
. Select a pit (test definition) of a protocol supported by the network device, such as BMP, so that Peach can communicate with device protocol during fuzzing.
* Give the pit a name and a description. Peach makes a configuration file of the selections you make, so that you can re-use the setup again.
. From the configuration menu along the left edge of the window, select Monitoring.
. Fill in a name for the agent. Since this agent resides within Peach, the default
location `local` is appropriate.

===== Supplying Monitor Details

Begin each monitor with a name or descriptive text. This helps identify one monitor from
another.

Next, fill in the critical parameters for each monitor. These parameters have callouts in
the settings diagram of each monitor. Details for these parameters are given in the text
that follows.

NOTE: The order of the monitors listed in the agent is significant. Peach processes
the monitors in the order listed (from top to bottom). For example, a blocking
situation or incorrect test results might occur if the sequencing is incorrect. In fact,
PageHeap sets some settings for the Windows Debugger, so you you need to declare the PageHeap monitor first.

For this recipe, use the monitors in the order they are presented:

* PageHeap (Fault Assist)
* WinDebugger (WaitforBootOnStartAndFault)

===== PageHeap Monitor (FaultAssist)

The xref:Monitors_PageHeap[PageHeap Monitor] enables heap allocation monitoring for
an executable through the Windows debugger. Peach sets and clears the parameters used for monitoring heap allocation at the beginning and end of the fuzzing session.

The *Executable* parameter identifies the application or executable file that is the fuzzing target. Specify the file name, with the file extension. The path is not needed nor wanted.

===== Windows Debugger Monitor (FaultDataAndAutomation)

The xref:Monitors_WindowsDebugger[Windows Debugger Monitor] controls a Windows
debugger instance. This monitor launches an executable file, a process, a service, or
a kernel driver with the debugger attached; or, this monitor can attach the debugger
to a running executable, process, or service. This monitor can also attach the
debugger to kernel-mode drivers, although that lies outside the scope of this documentation.

The *Arguments* parameter identifies command-line arguments for the executable file. The value of this parameter provides command-line switches and data file names needed to launch the executable file.

The *Executable* parameter identifies the application or executable file to launch
via the debugger. If the executable has command-line arguments, specify these using
the "Arguments" parameter.

The *StartOnCall* parameter defers launching the target until the state model issues a
call to the monitor to begin. Upon receiving the call, the debugger starts the process.

==== Summary

When fuzzing files on Windows, you need two monitors: PageHeap for heap allocation and the Windows Debugger that performs the vast majority of work. You also need to launch Peach
from an administrative console. A snapshot of the agent setup follows:

When ready, test the configuration. See xref:Test_PitConfiguration[Text Pit Configuration] for more information.

Also, see xref:Start_Fuzzing[Fuzzing Session] for information on running a fuzzing job.
