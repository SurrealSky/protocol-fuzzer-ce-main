[[Extending]]
== Extending Peach

{product} was designed to be extended,
allowing you to increase Peach's capabilities.
The most common reasons for extending Peach include:
--
* Custom validation algorithms (such as checksums)
* Custom publishers (I/O adapters)
* Monitoring
--

Peach can use custom implementations of the following to extend its functionality:

* xref:Agent[Agents]
* xref:Analyzers[Analyzers]
* xref:Fixup[Fixups]
* xref:Logger[Loggers]
* xref:Monitors[Monitors]
* xref:Publisher[Publishers]
* xref:Transformer[Transformers]

All extensions follow the same paradigm:
--
. Create a C# class that derives from the appropriate Peach base class.
. Decorate the class with the appropriate plugin attribute.
. Compile the class into an assembly and place the assembly in the Plugins directory.
--

This section covers the most common types of extensions for Peach.
