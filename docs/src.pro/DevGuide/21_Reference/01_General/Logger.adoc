[[Logger]]
== Loggers

Loggers allow adding additional logging methods into Peach.  Every Peach fuzzing job will always receive the default Peach logger.  Typical reasons for adding custom loggers include:

* Integration into end-user systems
* Custom notification (SMS, Email, Pager)

NOTE: It may be easier to use the Peach REST API for performing integration work.

[[Loggers_File]]
=== File

The file system logger needs a specified path.  Peach creates a folder containing the run name and time stamp.  Inside of this folder are the actual logs.  Until the first fault emerges, Peach logs very little information to conserve disk space.

TIP: The source to this monitor is provided in the SDK as an example.
