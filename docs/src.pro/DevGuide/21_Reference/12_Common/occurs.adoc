_occurs_ is a combination of xref:minOccurs[minOccurs] and xref:maxOccurs[maxOccurs]. 

The _occurs_ value (for the specified data element) is the exact number of element occurrences. Peach treats _occurs_ as an array.

=== Example

The following block is an array that occurs a fixed number of times.     

[source,xml]
----
<Block name="OccursBlock" occurs="5">
  <String name="occurs" value="A"/>
</Block>
----

Produces the output:  

---- 
AAAAA
