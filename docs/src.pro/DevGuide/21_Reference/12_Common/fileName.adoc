[[fileName]]
== fileName ==

When used with the xref:Data[Data] element, _fileName_ can specify any of the following:

* A single file ("+sample.png+"),
* Multiple files by pointing to a folder ("+samples+"), or 
* Multiple files by providing a file glob ("+samples_*.jpg+").

If a folder or file glob specifies multiple files, use the _switchCount_  attribute with the xref:MutationStrategies[random strategy] to specify the number of iterations performed before switching to the next file.

IMPORTANT: Multiple files are ONLY supported by the random mutation strategy.
