== Ref Attribute

// Reviewed:
//  - 01/30/2014: Seth & Mike: Outlined

// * Use examples from slides to walk through what ref does.
// * Perhaps this is more terse than the long description in the booky part.
// * Examples with output
// * Ref datamodel
// * Ref block
// * Ref with replacement
// * Ref with deep replacement
// * Ref only with datamodel and block, not single elements
// * Ref copies the full thing down
// * Ref with namespace (included xml file)
// * What about new element that was not in original parent (goes at end)
// * How we find elements by name (should include as this will be references from several places)
// * If no name attribute, will get the datamodel's name or a unique derivative
// * Replacing an element loses fixups, relations, transformers.

The ref attribute specifies a reference to another element by name or by class structure.  References can be relative or fully qualified.
