== Mutable Attribute ==

Mutable declares whether to fuzz this element, block, or data type. The default value is true, meaning that Peach fuzzes the element, block,  or data type.

IMPORTANT: Marking an element as non-mutable disables the mutators that normally operate on that element. Even when an element is marked as non-mutable, it may still be modified as the fuzzer fuzzes the other elements.  

WARNING: Marking elements as non-mutable usually leads to missing faults.  With that in mind, withhold use of this attribute unless: +
1) You know that the marked elements have already undergone fuzzing, and +
2) You are very familiar with the effects of this attribute (that is, you know what you are doing).
