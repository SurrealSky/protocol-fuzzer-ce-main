[[Publisher]]
=== Publishers

Publishers are the I/O interfaces Peach uses to send and receive data.

Publishers support both stream and call based operations.

When the fuzzer is running, all xref:Action[Actions] (except xref:Action_changeState[changeState] and xref:Action_slurp[slurp]) use a publisher to perform the action.

Different publishers support a different set of Action types.  For example, the xref:Publishers_File[File] publisher supports input for reading from a file, output for writing to a file, but does not support xref:Action_accept[accept] or xref:Action_call[call]. This differs from the xref:Publishers_Com[COM] publisher which supports xref:Action_call[call], but not xref:Action_input[input], xref:Action_output[output], or xref:Action_accept[accept].

All fuzzing definitions must use at least one Publisher and (optionally) can use multiple Publishers.  When using multiple Publishers, each Action must specify which Publisher it is referencing by including the Publisher's +name+ attribute in the Action's +publisher+ attribute. If the +publisher+ attribute is missing, Peach
performs the Action using the first Publisher defined in the Test.

==== Network Publishers

When fuzzing network protocols, publishers typically uses the protocol that encompasses (operates one layer below) the target protocol. For example, when fuzzing the HTTP protocol, use the xref:Publishers_Tcp[TCP] publisher.  When fuzzing TCP, use either the xref:Publishers_RawV4[RawV4] or xref:Publishers_RawV6[RawV6] publisher. When fuzzing IPv4 and IPv6, use the xref:Publishers_RawEther[RawEther] publisher.

==== Custom Publishers

Peach supports the creation of custom Publishers. We recommend that you review some of the existing Publishers' code before you create your own so you can understand how to implement a Publisher.

More information on creating a customer publisher can be found in the xref:ExtendingPeach_CustomPublisher[Create a Custom Publisher] chapter.

==== Examples

.Multiple Publishers
====================
Many of the licensed Pits use a single publisher; and, some Pits use multiple publishers. Peach imposes no limit on the number of publishers to use in a Pit.

For example, you might use multiple publishers to communicate with a network service that listens on multiple ports:
