The Choice element acts like a switch statement in programming languages.

The Choice element is a child element of xref:DataModel[DataModel] or xref:Block[Block].  Choice elements are expected to have valid sub-elements; Peach will select a sub-element to fuzz.

=== Syntax

[source,xml]
----
<Choice name="ChoiceBlock">
  <Block name="Type1">
    <!-- ... -->
  </Block>
  <Block name="Type2">
    <!-- ... -->
  </Block>
  <Block name="Type3">
    <!-- ... -->
  </Block>
</Choice>

=== Attributes

_Required:_

None.

_Optional:_

xref:name[name]:: Name of the choice section.
xref:length[length]:: Data element length.
xref:lengthType[lengthType]:: Length attribute unit of measure. Defaults to bytes.
xref:mutable[mutable]:: Element mutability. Defaults to false.
xref:constraint[constraint]:: Scripting expression that evaluates to true or false. Defaults to null.

xref:minOccurs[minOccurs]::
	The minimum number of times this element must occur. Defaults to 1.  +
	* Used to define arrays with variable size. Arrays defined by min/maxOccurs generally have a relation
	defined.
	* Adding this attribute, even with a value of 1, converts the element to an array.

xref:maxOccurs[maxOccurs]::
	The maximum number of times this element can occur. Defaults to 1.  +
	* Used to define arrays with static size.
	* Adding this attribute, even with a value of 1, converts the element to an array.

xref:occurs[occurs]::
	Actual occurrences of element. Defaults to 1.  +
	* Used to define arrays with static size.
	* Adding this attribute, even with a value of 1, converts the element to an array.

=== Child Elements

xref:Analyzers[Analyzer]:: Analyze current element post cracking, can dynamically change model.
xref:Blob[Blob]:: Represents binary data (array of bytes) to create simple dumb fuzzers in Peach.
xref:Block[Block]:: Group one or more data elements in a logical structure.
xref:Choice[Choice]:: Indicate all of the sub-elements are valid; however, only one sub-element should be selected.
xref:Fixup[Fixup]:: Are dynamic transformations such as checksums and CRCs.
xref:Flags[Flags]:: Defines a set of bit sized flags.
xref:Hint[Hint]:: Provides information to mutators.
xref:Number[Number]:: Defines a binary number of lengths 8, 16, 24, 32, or 64 bits.
xref:Padding[Padding]:: Pads variably sized blocks or data models to provide uniformity or consistency.
xref:Placement[Placement]:: Relocates an element after it has been cracked.
xref:Transformer[Transformer]:: Performs static transformations such as compression or encoding.
xref:XmlElement[XmlElement]:: Defines an XML element, the basic building block of XML documents.

=== Mutators

The following mutators operate on this element type:


_Enabled when an element is marked as an array_

xref:Mutators_ArrayNumericalEdgeCasesMutator[ArrayNumericalEdgeCasesMutator]:: This mutator grows and shrinks an array to counts based on numerical edge cases.
xref:Mutators_ArrayRandomizeOrderMutator[ArrayRandomizeOrderMutator]:: This mutator randomizes the order of items in an array.
xref:Mutators_ArrayReverseOrderMutator[ArrayReverseOrderMutator]:: This mutator reverses the order of items in an array.
xref:Mutators_ArrayVarianceMutator[ArrayVarianceMutator]:: This mutator grows and shrinks an array to a variance of counts based on the current size.

_Used for all data elements_

xref:Mutators_DataElementBitFlipper[DataElementBitFlipper]:: This mutator produces test cases by flipping bits in the output value.
xref:Mutators_DataElementDuplicate[DataElementDuplicate]:: This mutator duplicates data elements.
xref:Mutators_DataElementRemove[DataElementRemove]:: This mutator removes data elements.
xref:Mutators_DataElementSwapNear[DataElementSwapNear]:: This mutator swaps data elements.
xref:Mutators_SampleNinjaMutator[SampleNinjaMutator]:: This mutator combines data elements from different data sets.

_Enabled when element is part of a size relation_

xref:Mutators_SizedDataEdgeCase[SizedDataEdgeCase]:: This mutator causes the data portion of a relation to be sized as numerical edge cases.
xref:Mutators_SizedDataVariance[SizedDataVariance]:: This mutator causes the data portion of a relation to be sized as numerical variances.
xref:Mutators_SizedEdgeCase[SizedEdgeCase]:: This mutator changes both sides of the relation (data and value) to match numerical edge cases.
xref:Mutators_SizedVariance[SizedVariance]:: This mutator changes both sides of the relation (data and value) to match numerical variances of the current size.

_Specific to this element type_

xref:Mutators_ChoiceSwitch[ChoiceSwitch]:: This mutator produces test cases by arbitrarily changing the selected sub-element of a Choice.


=== Examples

.Basic Example
==========================
A basic Choice block. This choice example cracks or consumes data of type 1, 2, and 3. Much like a regular switch statement, a decision needs to be made on a token.

If the first 8 bits are 1, the remaining data is treated as a 32 bit number.
If the first 8 bits are 2, the remaining data is treated as a 255 bytes of binary data.
If the first 8 bits are 3, the remaining data is treated as a 8 byte string.

When fuzzing, Peach chooses one of the three types and fuzzes the output as an 8 bit number followed by the corresponding type.

Peach attempts to fill all three types. You can use data sets to specify which choice to make at different stages in the state model.

==========================

.An Array of Choices
==========================
The first example is good for making a single choice but what if there are many Type1, Type2, and Type3 blocks following one another? An array is the form to use. To declare the _Choice_ as an array, set the minOccurs, maxOccurs, or occurs attribute to specify that the choice should be repeated.

This example attempts to crack at least 3 different choices and no more than 6.
