== StringAsciiRandom

This mutator produces test cases by generating random ASCII strings. Characters that comprise the strings use the 7-bit ASCII collating sequence, values 0x00 - 0x7F.

The lengths of the generated strings form a distribution that centers on the length of the current string and ranges from 0 to 65K characters.
