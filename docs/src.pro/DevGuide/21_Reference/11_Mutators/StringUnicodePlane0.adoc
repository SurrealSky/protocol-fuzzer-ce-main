== StringUnicodePlane0

This mutator produces test cases for Unicode String elements by generating new strings and populating the strings with randomly-selected values from Unicode plane 0 (basic multilingual plane) characters. The lengths of the generated strings form a distribution that centers on the length of the current string and ranges from 1 to 65K (ushort max) Unicode characters.

This mutator requires Strings that have a Unicode encoding type: UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

=== Supported Elements
