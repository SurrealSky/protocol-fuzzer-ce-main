== StringUnicodePrivateUseArea

This mutator produces test cases for Unicode String elements by generating new strings and populating the strings with randomly-selected values from characters U+E000 – U+F8FF of Unicode plane 0 (private use area of the BMP). The lengths of the generated strings form a distribution that centers on the length of the current string and ranges from 1 to 65K (ushort max) Unicode characters.

This mutator requires String elements that have a Unicode encoding type: UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

=== Supported Elements
