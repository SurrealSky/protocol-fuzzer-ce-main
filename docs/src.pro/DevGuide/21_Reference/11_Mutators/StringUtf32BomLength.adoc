[[Mutators_StringUtf32BomLength]]
== StringUtf32BomLength

The _StringUtf32BomLength_ mutator produces test cases for Unicode UTF-32 strings by altering an individual string in two ways:

* Adjust the length of the string using the xref:Mutators_StringLengthVariance[StringLengthVariance] mutator
* Insert 1 to 6 Unicode Byte Ordering Marks (BOMs) in arbitrary places in the string

BOM are not considered characters, and using them can cause buffer length calculations to be incorrect.

BOM marks, whether for Big Endian-ness or for Little Endian-ness, are selected arbitrarily.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints

This mutator does not support any hints.
