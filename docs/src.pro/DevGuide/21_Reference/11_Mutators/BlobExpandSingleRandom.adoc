[[Mutators_BlobExpandSingleRandom]]
== BlobExpandSingleRandom

This mutator produces test cases in which a random number of contiguous bytes having the same value are inserted in a xref:Blob[Blob]. The location where the insertion starts is randomly-determined as is the number of inserted bytes. The number of inserted bytes range from 1 to 255.

The value used for the inserted bytes is randomly selected from the range of 0x00 to 0xff.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Blob[Blob]

=== Hints

BlobExpandSingleRandom-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change.
BlobMutator-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change. The value of this Hint affects other Blob mutators.
