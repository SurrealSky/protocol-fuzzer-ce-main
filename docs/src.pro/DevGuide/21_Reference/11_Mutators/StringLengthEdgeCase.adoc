[[Mutators_StringLengthEdgeCase]]
== StringLengthEdgeCase

This mutator produces test cases for String elements. The test cases produced are length edge cases created by shrinking and growing the string as needed.

The lengths are generated using a Gaussian distribution around numerical edge cases. Edge cases are defined as integer boundaries for signed/unsigned number representations and for bit boundaries (0, 8, 16, 32, 64).

The maximum size string generated by this mutator is 65K characters.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]
