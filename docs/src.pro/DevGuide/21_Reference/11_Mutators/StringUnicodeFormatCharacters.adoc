== StringUnicodeFormatCharacters

This mutator produces test cases for Unicode String elements by generating new strings and then populating the strings with a random set of Unicode format characters. A format character has no visible appearance, but can affect the appearance or behavior of neighboring or subsequent characters. The lengths of the generated strings form a distribution that centers on the current string length and ranges from 1 to 65k Unicode characters.

This mutator requires String elements that have a Unicode encoding type: UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

Unicode 7.0 contains 152 format characters. A couple of format character examples follow:

* U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER is a format character that inhibits ligatures.

* U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER is a formation character that requests a ligature formation.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints

This mutator does not support hints.
