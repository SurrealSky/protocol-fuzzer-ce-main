[[Mutators_NumberEdgeCase]]
== NumberEdgeCase

This mutator produces test cases for Number and String elements. String elements are only supported when the default data they contain is an integer. The test cases are generated using a Gaussian distribution around numerical edge cases. Edge cases are defined as boundaries between signed/unsigned and bit boundaries (0, 8, 16, 32, 64).

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]
 * xref:Number[Number]

=== Hints

This mutator does not support hints.
