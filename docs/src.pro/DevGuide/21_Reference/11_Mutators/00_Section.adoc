[[Mutators]]

=== Mutators

Mutators perform the actual data changes to models that produce fuzzed output. The fuzzing strategy decides
how and when to apply mutators. During a fuzzing session, Peach weights mutators based on the number of
variations of data that each mutator generates. Peach selects mutators that generate more variations
more frequently than mutators that generate fewer variations of fuzzed data.

A typical mutator performs a single type of change. For example, the _BlobBitFlipperMutator_ performs bit flipping on _Blob_ elements. Most mutators have no or very little state or complex logic.

Mutators that are associated with state have a prefix for identification, either State or Action.

Custom mutators are relatively easy to write.

To focus on using a specific set of mutators in a fuzzing session, specify the mutators to use or those not to use during a fuzzing run in the xref:Test[_Test_] element of the Pit. Most often, Peach considers all mutations and uses all mutations appropriate for the DataModel.

The following sections provide descriptions of each mutator, as well as hints and configuration options.
