[[Mutators_StringUtf16BomStatic]]
== StringUtf16BomStatic

The _StringUtf16BomStatic_ mutator produces test cases for Unicode UTF-16 strings by creating a mutated string in two ways:

* Create a string using the xref:Mutators_StringStatic[StringStatic] mutator
* Inject 1 to 6 Unicode Byte Ordering Marks (BOMs) in arbitrary places in the string

BOM are not considered characters, and injecting BOMs into a string that might be filtered could cause
the filtering not to work and the string would be accepted.

BOM marks, whether for Big Endian-ness or for Little Endian-ness, are selected arbitrarily.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints

This mutator does not support any hints.
