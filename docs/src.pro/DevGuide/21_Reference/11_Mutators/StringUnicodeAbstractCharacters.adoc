== StringUnicodeAbstractCharacters

This mutator produces test cases for Unicode String elements by generating new strings and then populating the strings with a random set of Unicode abstract characters.
The lengths of the generated strings form a distribution that centers on the current string length and ranges from 1 to 65k Unicode characters.

This mutator requires String elements that have a Unicode encoding type: UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints
