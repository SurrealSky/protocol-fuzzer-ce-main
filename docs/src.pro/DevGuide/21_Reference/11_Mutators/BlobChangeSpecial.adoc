[[Mutators_BlobChangeSpecial]]
== BlobChangeSpecial

This mutator produces test cases in which a random number of contiguous bytes in a xref:Blob[Blob] are individually changed using a small set of replacement values. The location where the change occurs is randomly-determined as is the number of bytes altered in the mutation. The number of bytes that receive new values range from 1 to 100.

Each altered value randomly receives one of the following replacement values: 0x00, 0x01, 0xFE, or 0xFF.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Blob[Blob]

=== Hints

BlobChangeSpecial-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change.
BlobMutator-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change. The value of this Hint affects other Blob mutators.
