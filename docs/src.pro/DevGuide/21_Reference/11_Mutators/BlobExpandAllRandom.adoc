== BlobExpandAllRandom

This mutator produces test cases in which a random number of contiguous bytes are inserted in a xref:Blob[Blob]. The location where the insertion starts is randomly determined, as is the number of inserted bytes. The number of inserted bytes range from 1 to 255.
The value of each inserted byte is a different randomly-selected value.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Blob[Blob]

=== Hints

BlobExpandAllRandom-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change.
BlobMutator-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change. The value of this Hint affects other Blob mutators.
