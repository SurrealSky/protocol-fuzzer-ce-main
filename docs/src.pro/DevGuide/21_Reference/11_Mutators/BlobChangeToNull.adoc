== BlobChangeToNull

This mutator produces test cases in which a random number of contiguous bytes in a xref:Blob[Blob] are changed to null. The location where the change occurs is randomly-determined as is the number of bytes altered in the mutation. The number of bytes that receive the null value range from 1 to 100.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Blob[Blob]
