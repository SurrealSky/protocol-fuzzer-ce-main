[[Mutators_SizedDataVariance]]
== SizedDataVariance

This mutator produces test cases for elements that are part of a size relationship. The SizedDataVariance Mutator causes the data in a sized element to expand such that the relationship is invalid. The data portion of the relationship expands, while the physical size of the field is static.

The test cases are produced using a Gaussian distribution with the current default value as the center of the distribution.

Values used in the test cases never require more storage than the maximum size the size provider can handle. For example, values used for a signed 16-bit integer do not exceed 32,767.

NOTE: This mutator is similar to the xref:Mutators_NumberVariance[NumberVariance] Mutator.

=== Supported Elements

Elements that are part of a size relationship: numbers and strings. String elements are only supported when the default data they contain is integer values.

=== Hints

This mutator does not support hints.
