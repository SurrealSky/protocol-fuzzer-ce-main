== StateChangeRandom

This mutator produces test cases that affect the flow of the state model. During a state change, starting with selecting the initial state, the state change can land on a randomly-selected state. This mutator can be enabled if more than one state is available.

NOTE: Currently, state model mutations are disabled by default.

=== Supported Elements

All states defined in the state model.

=== Hints

This mutator does not support hints.
