[[Mutators_BlobChangeRandom]]
== BlobChangeRandom

This mutator produces test cases in which a random number of contiguous bytes in a xref:Blob[Blob] are changed. The location where the change occurs is randomly-determined as is the number of bytes altered in the mutation. The number of contiguous bytes that receive new and different values range from 1 to 100.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Blob[Blob]

=== Hints

BlobChangeRandom-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change.
BlobMutator-N:: Standard deviation of the number of bytes to change. The value of this Hint affects other Blob mutators.
