== Configuration Files

Most Peach pits contain configurable information. For example, a network Pit might store source and destination IP addresses for the network. Some configuration settings apply to a specific operating system.

Peach uses configuration files that allow different settings based on operating system. The information stored in a configuration file is typically used many times in a single definition and rarely stays the same. The presence of a configuration file eases the burden of supplying configurable settings by hand, an awkward and error-prone task.

You can create configuration files with default values and reuse them as needed. Peach configuration files use placeholders that are replaced at runtime either through a configuration file or via the command line. Peach automatically tries to load a configuration file along with the Pit file at the start of a fuzzing session. The naming convention of a Pit configuration file is +PIT.xml.config+, where +PIT.xml+ is the name of your fuzzing definition.

Using a defined key consists of encasing the key with the two-character sequence `\\##`. So, the key _Interface_ becomes `##Interface##`, as shown in the following example.

[source,xml]
----
<Monitor class="NetworkCapture">
  <Param name="Device" value="##Interface##"/>
</Monitor>

<Publisher class="Tcp" name="TcpHandler">
  <Param name="Host" value="##TargetIPv4##"/>
  <Param name="Port" value="##TargetPort##"/>
</Publisher>

Overriding one configuration file with a second (or another) configuration file requires using the +--config+ command-line argument. The values in the file specified on the command line override the values listed in the default .config file.

----
Peach.exe --config=CommonConfig.xml MyPit.xml
----

You can specify individual configuration items (keys) on the command line by using the +-D+ argument. Values provided via the command line override those provided by file.

----
Peach.exe -DTargetIp=10.1.1.1 MyPit.xml

=== Internally-defined Keys

Peach includes several predefined configuration keys that can be used in your Pits.

Peach.Cwd:: Peach current working directory. While this directory is usually the
directory containing Peach, the directory can be another location on your system.
The Peach Working Directory is set by launching Peach from the shell command line.
The value is the current working directory of the command shell when you start Peach.

PitLibraryPath:: The Pit library path is the full path of the folder in the
Peach installation directory that contains your licensed Peach Pits and Pit Packs.
The folder name is "pits", and contains subdirectories that hold your licensed
Pits, Pit configurations, and Peach-supplied sample files.

Peach.LogRoot:: Full path of the directory where Peach stores logging information
from each fuzzing session. The default log root location is a subdirectory of
the Peach Installation Directory. The default name of this directory is "Logs".

Peach.OS:: Operating system that hosts the Peach Fuzzer platform. The value is
selected when downloading the Peach distribution image.

Peach.Pwd:: Peach installation directory. This directory contains the Peach executable, and usually is named "peach".
