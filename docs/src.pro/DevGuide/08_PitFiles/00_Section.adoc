== Pit Files

Peach Pit files are XML files that contain all of the information needed for Peach to perform a fuzzing run. When starting a fuzzing session, Peach uses a Peach Pit file and, sometimes, an associated configuration file.

Peach provides several Pit files that, with some configuration settings, run out-of-the-box. If your needs extend beyond the Pit library, you can create a new Pit file from scratch or by modifying an existing Pit file.

Peach Pit files contain the following elements:

* xref:GeneralConfiguration[General Configuration elements]
* xref:DataModel[Data Modeling elements]
* xref:StateModel[State Modeling elements]
* xref:AgentsMonitors[Agents and Monitors]
* xref:TestConfig[Test Configuration elements]

// end
