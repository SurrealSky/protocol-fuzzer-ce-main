== Optimize Testing

At this point, we could just kick off our fuzzer and grab a beer; but, we can optimize our fuzzer in a few ways to reduce the number of iterations it will perform.  For example, all of the actual PCM/WAV samples and music data is probably something that doesn't need much fuzzing.  All that fuzzing the music data will do is create unhappy sounds.
So, let's dial down the mutators that will run against them.
