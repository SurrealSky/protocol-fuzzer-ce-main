== The Peach Development Environment

Before we start building our Peach fuzzer let's first take a moment to talk about a normal Peach development environment.  Here is what a typical environment looks like:

=== XML Editor

A good XML editor is definitely a must.  A good free XML editor for Windows is http://www.microsoft.com/Express/[Microsoft Visual Studio Express] edition.  If you already have an XML editor that supports intelliSense via XML Schema, you're all set.

=== Latest Peach

Always stay up to date on the version of Peach you are using to get the latest bug fixes.

===  Debugger and support tools

There are several support tools that make things work a lot nicer.

 * On Windows, download the Microsoft Debugging Tools for Windows.
 * On OS X, download CrashWrangler.

Both of these tools are covered in the installation chapter.
