[[TutorialFileFuzzing_CreateStateModel]]
== Create State Model

Now that you have created the data models we can create the state model.
For file fuzzing the state model is very simple.
All we want to do is write out the file and launch the target process.
We can do this using three actions:

 * output -- Write the file
 * close -- Close the file
 * call -- Launch the application

Go ahead and locate the state model in the +wav.xml+ file called _TheState_.
We will expand on this state model to include our three actions as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- This is our simple wave state model -->
<StateModel name="TheState" initialState="Initial">
    <State name="Initial">

        <!-- Write out our wave file -->
        <Action type="output">
            <DataModel ref="Wav"/>
            <!-- This is our sample file to read in -->
            <Data fileName="sample.wav"/>
        </Action>

        <Action type="close"/>

        <!-- Launch the target process -->
        <Action type="call" method="StartMPlayer" publisher="Peach.Agent" />
    </State>
</StateModel>
