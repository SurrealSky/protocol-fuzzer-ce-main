=== {protocol}-Slave

This configuration will test an application using {protocol}.
ifdef::advancedconfigname[]
It has two versions, a basic configuration and an advanced configuration.
The basic configuration is compiled only with the Debug option.
The advanced configuration is compiled with Address Sanitizer, Debug, and Optimization Level 1 options.

===== Configuring Variables

The first thing you need to configure are the variables that control how {product} will test the application.
ifdef::advnacedconfigname[]
Both the Basic and Advanced configuration will use the same variables with the same values.
endif::[]
Follow these steps to create a working configuration on your trial instance:

. Click *Configure Variables*.
. Configure your variables as appropriate for your application.  The following
should be used for {targetapp} running on the trial instance:
ifdef::hosted[]
.. Target IPv4 Address: set to *127.0.0.1*
endif::[]
ifndef::hosted[]
.. Target IPv4 Address: set to the IP address of the target VM, e.g. *192.168.17.145*
endif::[]
.. Target Port: Leave the default value of *20000* since {targetapp} will also default to this port.
.. DNP3 Target Address: Set to *10* to match the configuration of {targetapp}.
.. DNP3 Source Address: Set to *1* to match the configuration of {targetapp}.
.. Under *Advanced Configuration*, leave all the defaults as they are acceptable for {targetapp}.
.. Under System Defines, do NOT change any of the values present.  These values normally do not require changing.
. Once all the settings have the desired values, click *Save*.
