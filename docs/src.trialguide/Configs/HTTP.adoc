===== Configuring Variables

The first thing you need to configure are the variables that control how {product} will test the application.
ifdef::advancedconfigname[]
Both the Basic and Advanced configuration will use the same variables with the same values.
endif::[]
Follow these steps to create a working configuration on your trial instance:

. Click *Configure Variables*.
. Configure your variables as appropriate for your application.  The following
should be used for {targetapp} running on the trial instance:
ifdef::hosted[]
.. Target IPv4 Address: set to *127.0.0.1*
endif::[]
ifndef::hosted[]
.. Target IPv4 Address: set to the IP address of the target VM e.g. *192.168.17.145*
endif::[]
.. Target Port: set to 4040 as {targetapp} will also use to this port.
.. HTTP Host Header: set to *peachapisec* as {targetapp} has been configured to use this host name.
.. Under *Advanced Configuration*, leave all the defaults as they are acceptable for {targetapp}.
.. Under System Defines, do NOT change any of the values present.  These values normally do not require changing.
. Once all the settings have the desired values, click *Save*.
