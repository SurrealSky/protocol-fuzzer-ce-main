[[SampleConfigurations]]
== Sample Configurations

The following are sample configurations for several different protocols as well as file types that {product} can fuzz.
ifdef::hosted[]
Each sample will already be present and configured on your trial instance.
In addition, a test run for each sample is already present on the trial instance so that you can easily view the test results and see the types of faults that {product} can find.
endif::[]
You can run the sample configurations with the supplied seed values in this guide.
Each section below has instructions for how to set up the sample configuration, including a brief
explanation of why {product} has been configured this way for this particular application.
It is strongly recommended that you use the supplied values in each section for the *Seed* and *Stop Test Case* (and *Start Test Case* if indicated).
These values have been selected to guarantee that you can create a test run that will find faults in the target applications within a few minutes.

ifndef::hosted[]
NOTE: For the purposes of this document we will assume the target VM has an IP address of +192.168.17.145+ and this IP address will be used wherever the host's IP address is required.
If you see this value used for an IP address in a configuration, replace it with the actual IP address of your VM.

[[ViewResults]]
=== Viewing the Sample Job Results

ifdef::hosted[]
Your trial instance already has test runs for each available sample configuration.
These can be viewed from the Jobs page.
endif::[]
Any additional test runs you perform will be available on the Jobs page.
To view the results:

. From the Home page, click the Jobs tab.
+
image::{images}/click-jobs.png[]
. Click the job you wish to view from the list of available jobs.
+
image::{images}/select-job.png[]
. The results of the selected job will now be displayed.
You can see the overall results which will indicate the parameters with which the job was run and the faults that were found.
You can examine the <<ExamineFaults, faults>> individually or <<DownloadReport, download a report>> that summarizes all of the findings in this job run.


[[RunningSamples]]
=== Running the Samples

ifdef::hosted[]
To run the pre-configured examples:

. Click *Library* 
+
image::{images}/click-library.png[]
. Under *Configurations*, click the name of the sample configuration that you wish to run
+
image::{images}/sample-configs.png[]
NOTE: Your trial instance may not have every Configuration pictured here.  
endif::[]
ifndef::hosted[]
You will need to configure the pits to run with the target VM instance you have created.
Select a PIT listed below for detailed instructions on how to configure the pit for a test run.
endif::[]
The exact Configurations available will depend on what Pits are included with your trial license.
. Enter the appropriate values for *Seed* and *Stop Test Case*.
. Enter the appropriate value for *Start Test Case* if specified.  Otherwise, leave the default of *1*.
