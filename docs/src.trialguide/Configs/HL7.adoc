=== {protocol}

This configuration will test an application using HL7.
The application on the trial instance is Mirth Connect

NOTE: Mirth Connect is a Java application, so testing this is slightly 
different than what might be done for an application written in a non-managed 
language in terms of the monitors that are used.

===== Configuring Variables

The first thing you need to configure are the variables that control how {product} will test the application.
Follow these steps to create a working configuration on your trial instance:

. Click *Configure Variables*.
. Configure your variables as appropriate for your application.  The following
should be used for Mirth Connect running on the trial instance:
.. Target IPv4 Address: set to *127.0.0.1* since that is what {targetapp} is configured to listen on
.. Target Port: set to *6661*.  {targetapp} has an {protocol} configuration already present that uses this port
.. Sample Path: Leave the default *{2H}PitLibraryPath##/_Common/Samples/Application*.
.. Sample Path: Leave the default *{2H}PitLibraryPath##/_Common/Samples/Application*.
.. Seed File: Leave the default *{asterisk}.hl7*.
.. Under Advanced Configuration, leave all the defaults as they are acceptable for Mirth Connect.  If you have an application that takes a long time to start up or process messages (e.g. when using a debug build or running on slower hardware), then you may need to increase the values of some or all of these settings.
.. Under System Defines, do NOT change any of the values present.  These values normally do not require changing.
.. Once all the settings have the desired values, click *Save*.

===== Configuring Monitors
For this configuration, you will want the following monitors:

* *Process Monitor*.
This will allow {product} to launch {targetapp} so that it can fuzz the application.
* *Syslog Monitor*.
{targetapp} will log exceptions to the syslog, so this monitor will allow {product} to detect faults by monitoring the syslog for exceptions.
For other applications, this monitor can be useful to gather data about the state of the application when a fault was found, but in this particular case it is the best way to determine if a fault has occurred.
* *Network Capture monitor*.
Since {protocol} is a network protocol, this monitor will allow {product} to capture the actual data that was sent and received as a pcap.
This will help determine what may have caused a fault and could also be useful in trying to create a repro or test case that can aid in creating a fix for the application.
Any configuration that is fuzzing a network protocol should typically have this monitor.

To add and configure the monitors:

. Click *Add Monitor*.  In the pop-up, scroll down and select Process.  Click *Ok*.
. Under *Executable*, enter *{targetexe}* which is the location of {targetapp}'s launcher. 
This will allow the monitor to launch the application when fuzzing starts.
Do not change any of the other settings for this monitor.
. Click *Save*.

. Click *Add Monitor* and select *Syslog*.
. Leave the defaults for *Interface* and *Port*
. Under *Fault Regex*, enter *.[a-zA-Z]+Exception:.* so that the monitor will log a fault any time {targetapp} throws an exception.
This is the best way to detect faults for this particular Java application
. Click *Save*.

. Click *Add Monitor*.  In the pop-up, scroll down and select *Network Capture* under the *Data Collection* section.  Click *Ok*.
. Under *Device*, enter *lo* (for loopback, since {targetapp} is listening on the loopback interface)
. Under *Filter*, enter *port {2H}TargetPort##* to capture all traffic going to or from the port you specified when you configured the variables in the previous section.
. Click *Save*.
