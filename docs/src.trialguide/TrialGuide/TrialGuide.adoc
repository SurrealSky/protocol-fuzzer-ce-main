// This document is one of two books that together form the official
// documentation for Peach Fuzzer Professional.
//
// The User Guide supports and guides the user through daily activities that
// can otherwise impede tasks associated with fuzzing.
//
// It is not theoretical, nor designed to tackle advanced configurations.
// The primary audience is a daily user, not a developer and not knowledgeable about XML.

// NOTE: This book documents the commercial version of Peach
