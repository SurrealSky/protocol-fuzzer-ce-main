===== Configuring the monitors for {configtype}
The {configtype} configuration is targeting {targetapp} compiled with {compileroptions}.
endif::[]
ifndef::configtype[]
===== Configuring the monitors
This configuration is targeting {targetapp} compiled with {compileroptions}.
endif::[]
You will therefore want the following monitors:

ifdef::gdb[]
* *Gdb Monitor*.
This will allow {product} to launch {targetapp} from within GDB so that GDB attaches to {targetapp}.
{product} will monitor GDB and attempt to analyze any crashes that GDB detects based on receiving signals from the application being tested.
endif::[]
ifdef::delaystarthack[]
// hack for sleep
* *RunCommand Monitor*
In this case, {targetapp} takes a long time to load.
It is therefore necessary to add a means to delay starting the test run until the application has fully loaded.
To do this, the RunCommand Monitor can be used to run the bash "sleep" command.
{product} must wait both at the start of each session and the start of each iteration in case a fault was found and the target had to be restarted.
As a result, two monitors will be added with the same sleep command, one set to *OnStart* and the other set to *OnIterationStart*.
endif::[]
ifdef::process[]
* *Process Monitor*.
This will allow {product} to launch {targetapp}.
ifdef::asanwarn[]
Because {targetapp} is compiled with ASan, the Process Monitor will detect the program exited due to an error and gather the output from ASan about the nature of the crash.
+
WARNING: Do not use the GDB Monitor for applications that are compiled with ASan.
It is not compatible with ASan.
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::pcap[]
* *Network Capture monitor*.
Since {protocol} is a network protocol, this monitor will allow {product} to capture the actual data that was sent and received as a pcap.
This will help determine what may have caused a fault and could also be useful in trying to create a repro or test case that can aid in creating a fix for the application.
Any configuration that is fuzzing a network protocol should typically have this monitor.
endif::[]
ifdef::syslog[]
* *Syslog Monitor*
The application writes entries to the syslog, which may be useful to capture for debugging purposes.
In some cases, may also be useful to trigger a fault if a particular syslog message is seen.

// Steps to configure, should be in same order as above
To add and configure the monitors:

ifdef::gdb[]
. Click *Add Monitor*.  In the pop-up, scroll down and select *Gdb*.  Click *Ok*.
. Under *Executable*, enter *{targetexe}* which is the location of {targetapp}'s launcher. 
This will allow the monitor to launch the application when fuzzing starts.
Do not change any of the other settings for this monitor.
ifdef::args[]
. Under *Arguments*, enter *{args}*.
endif::[]
ifdef::startonexit[]
. Under *Advanced*, set the value of *Start On Call* to *ExitIterationEvent*.
This is important because {product} will normally try to execute the target when the session starts.
Because this sample is fuzzing images with an application, the fuzzed image is actually created on each iteration.
As a result, the target has to be invoked at the end of the iteration in order to ensure that the fuzzed image has been created and written to a file for the target to process.
endif::[]
. Click *Save*.
+
image:{images}/{pitname}/gdb-monitor.png[]
endif::[]
ifdef::process[]
. Click *Add Monitor*.  In the pop-up, scroll down and select *Process*.  Click *Ok*.
. Under *Executable*, enter *{targetexe}* which is the location of {targetapp}'s launcher. 
This will allow the monitor to launch the application when fuzzing starts.
ifdef::args[]
. Under *Arguments*, enter *{args}*.
endif::[]
ifdef::startoncall[]
. Under *Advanced*, set the value of *Start On Call* to *StartIterationEvent*.
This is important because {product} will try to initially connect to {targetapp} before fuzzing begins.
Setting this to *StartIterationEvent* ensures that {product} will launch {targetapp} at the beginning of each test iteration so that {targetapp} is listening when {product} makes its initial connection.
Changing this setting is necessary when fuzzing network protocols for most server applications.
endif::[]
ifdef::startonexit[]
. Under *Advanced*, set the value of *Start On Call* to *ExitIterationEvent*.
This is important because {product} will normally try to execute the target when the session starts.
Because this sample is fuzzing images with an application, the fuzzed image is actually created on each iteration.
As a result, the target has to be invoked at the end of the iteration in order to ensure that the fuzzed image has been created and written to a file for the target to process.

ifdef::delaystarthack[]
. Click *Add Monitor*.  In the pop-up, scroll down and select *RunCommand*.
. Under *Command*, enter */bin/bash*.
. Under *Arguments*, enter *-c "sleep 1"*.  This will call the bash "sleep" command to sleep for 1 second.
. Under *When To Trigger*, set *When* to *OnStart* so that this will execute when the test session starts.
. Click *Save*

image:{images}/runcommand-onstart.png[]
. Click *Add Monitor*.  In the pop-up, scroll down and select *RunCommand*.
. The previous RunCommand monitor will have automatically used the name "Run Command" when it was created unless it was changed.  
You will need to give this RunCommand Monitor a different name.
Here, *Run Command On Iteration Start* is used.
. Under *Command*, enter */bin/bash*.
. Under *Arguments*, enter *-c "sleep 1"*.  This will call the bash "sleep" command to sleep for 1 second.
. Under *When To Trigger*, set *When* to *OnIterationStart* so that this executes when each iteration starts.
This is important because if a fault is found, {product} will re-start the target application and therefore needs to delay running the next iteration to give the target application enough time to load.
. Click *Save*
