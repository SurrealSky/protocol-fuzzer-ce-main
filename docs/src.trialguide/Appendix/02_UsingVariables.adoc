=== Using variables

{product} supports using variables for things such as parameters for monitors and values for other variables.
All variables are surrounded by double hash marks e.g. *{2h}*.
It is generally recommended to use variables whenever possible.

Variables are defined under the *Variables* section of a configuration.

A variable is referred to by its *Key* value in this section.
For example, this shows a variable called `TargetPort` that has a value of *20000*.

.The TargetPort variable is shown here.

This variable could be used anywhere the Target Port is needed, such as an argument passed to the command of a process monitor or a PCAP expression on a Network Capture Monitor.
To use the `TargetPort` variable elsewhere in the configuration, reference it as *{2h}TargetPort{2h}*.

.The TargetPort variable is used here to set a Network Capture Monitor to capture all traffic for this configuration.  In this example, traffic to and from port 20000 will be captured.

If the vale of a variable changes, it will automatically be applied everywhere the next time the configuration is run.
