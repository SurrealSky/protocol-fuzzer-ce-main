== Configure Publisher ==

The last thing we need todo before we can try out our nifty fuzzer is to configure a link:Publisher.html[Publisher].  link:Publisher.html[Publisher]s are I/O connectors that implement the plumbing between actions like _output_, _input_, and _call_.  For our file fuzzer we will use the link:Publisher.html[Publisher] called _tcp.Tcp_.  This publisher will allow us to connect to a remote host and send/receive data.

Configuring our publisher is easy, just locate the following XML near the bottom of the +mysql.xml+ file, it will be a child of link:Test.html[Test].

[source,xml]
----
<!-- TODO: Complete publisher -->
<Publisher />
----


Now, this publisher takes two parameters called _host_ and _port_ that will contain the MySQL hostname and port number respectively.

[source,xml]
----
<Publisher class="tcp.Tcp">
	<Param name="host" value="127.0.0.1"/>
	<Param name="port" value="3306"/>
</Publisher>
----


Now that we have the publisher configured we can test our fuzzer!

== Testing Fuzzer ==

Lets go ahead and run the fuzzer!  Open up a command window and navigate to the location of +mysql.xml+.  Now run the following command:

----
c:\mysql>c:\peach\peach.py -t mysql.xml

] Peach 2.2 Runtime
] Copyright (c) 2004-2008 Michael Eddington

File parsed with out errors.

----


Hopefully you got this output and no problems were found.  If a problem was found go back through the prior sections and try and identify the problem.

== Running Fuzzer ==

Now lets actually kick off our fuzzer for real!

----
c:\mysql>c:\peach\peach.py mysql.xml
----


Use Wireshark to verify the communication is correct.

== Whats Next? ==

Okay, now that we have a running fuzzer we will need to configure a way to detect when our target crashes.  We will also want to collect some information like a stack trace to look at later on.  Head to the next section to learn how to configure an agent and monitor.
