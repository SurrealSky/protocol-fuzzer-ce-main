== Running in Parallel ==

We have a nice optimized fuzzer now, but we still want to get our fuzzing done faster and it just so happens we have a couple extra machines sitting around just begging to be used for fuzzing.  Luckily Peach supports parallel fuzzing, and it's super easy.  All we need to do is add a single command line argument and run our fuzzer on each machine.  Here is how we do it:

== 1. Configure Machines ==

First we need to configure each machine to have:

 . Peach
 . Target application
 . +mysql.xml+

== 2. Run Peach ==

Next we just run the fuzzer on each machine.  To do this we need to start an agent on each machine:

----
c:\peach\peach.py -a
----


Next we can launch peach using this syntax:

*Machine #1*
----
c:\peach\peach.py -p3,0 mysql.xml
----


*Machine #2*
----
c:\peach\peach.py -p3,1 mysql.xml
----


*Machine #3*
----
c:\peach\peach.py -p3,2 mysql.xml
----


Notice that we are adding an argument "-p" to the command line with two numbers.  The first number indicates the total number of machines we will use and is 1 based (counting starts at 1).  The second number indicates the machine we are running Peach on.  This number is zero based (counting starts at 0, 1, 2, 3...).

EASY!
