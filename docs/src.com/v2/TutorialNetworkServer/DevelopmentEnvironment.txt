== The Peach Development Environment ==

Before we start building our Peach fuzzer lets first take a moment to talk about a normal Peach development environment.  Here is what a typical environment looks like:

== XML Editor ==

A good XML is definitely a must.  A good free XML editor for Windows is http://www.microsoft.com/Express/[Microsoft Visual Studio Express] edition.  If you already have an XML editor that supports intellisense via XML Schema your all set.

== Latest Peach ==

Always stay up to date on the version of Peach you are using to get the latest bug fixes.

==  Debugger and support tools ==

There are several support tools that make things work alot nicer.  On Windows you will want the following for this lab:

 * http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/Devtools/Debugging/default.mspx[Microsoft Debugging Tools]
 * http://msecdbg.codeplex.com/[Bang-Exploitable] a WinDbg plug-in

== Network Protocol Analyzer ==

Additionally, when dealing with network protocols a good sniffer/analyzer is needed.  I recommend the open source http://www.wireshark.org/[Wireshark] application.
