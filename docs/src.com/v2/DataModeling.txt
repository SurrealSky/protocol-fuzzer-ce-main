== Data Modeling ==

Peach Pit files contain at least one data model, and possibly more.  Data models 
describe data including type information, relation ships (size, count, offsets), and 
other information that allows the fuzzer to perform "smart" mutations.

Data models can be reused and references from other data models allowing complex data 
definitions to be broken up into readable portions.
