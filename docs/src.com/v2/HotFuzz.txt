== HotFuzz - Automatic Protocol Fuzzer ==

HotFuzz is an open source implementation of the Peach-In-The-Middle network fuzzing concept.  This concept has two main feature:

 . Modify Peach to act as a network proxy
 . Use Wiresharks protocol dissectors to perform smart fuzzing with no data model creation
 . Modify Peach agent system to drive the "network client" and monitor the "network server"

HotFuzz goes further and also provides a UI interface for usage and excellent documentation for both the user and developer.  HotFuzz is an automatic protocol fuzzer build on Peach fuzzing framework. It is two-semestral work of five students at Charles University in Prague. For more information, please refer to specification.
