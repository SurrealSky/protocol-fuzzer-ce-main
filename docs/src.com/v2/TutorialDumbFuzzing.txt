= Tutorial: Dumb Fuzzing =

Welcome to the dumb fuzzing tutorial, part of the Peach Quickstart.  In this tutorial we are going to build a simple dumb fuzzer for PNG graphics files (.png).  Our dumb fuzzer will use several sample files (also known as seed files) to mutate using methods like bit flipping, dword slides, etc.  The target of this fuzzer is http://www.mplayerhq.hu/[mplayer], an open-source, cross-platform, command line media player.
