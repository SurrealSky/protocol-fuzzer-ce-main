== Pointer Depth Attribute ==

The pointerDepth attribute is only used when modeling C structures that will be published by a publisher that supports the ctypes interface.  This attribute is only valid when +pointer="true"+ is also specified.  pointerDepth will indicate how many levels deep the pointer is (e.g. void** p is 2).  Default is 1.

Example XML:

[source,xml]
----

<Block name="HelloWorld" pointer="true" pointerDepth="3">
  <String value="Hello world!" />
</Block>
----


Would result in the following ctypes code:

[source,python]
----
class CustomStructure(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [ ("HelloWorld", c_char_p) ]

block = CustomStructure()
block["HelloWorld"] = c_char_p("Hello world!")

result = POINTER(POINTER(POINTER(block)))
----
