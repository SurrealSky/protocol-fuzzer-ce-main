== Name Attribute ==

Almost every element in a Peach Pit file supports the name attribute.  Names are used for both readability and also for referencing elements from other places.

Names should not contain punctuation, in particular period (.) or colon (:) as they have special meaning.

Examples of names:

[source,xml]
----
<Element name="MyStuff" />

<Element name="OtherThings" />
----
