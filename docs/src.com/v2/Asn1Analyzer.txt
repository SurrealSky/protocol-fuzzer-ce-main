= ASN.1 Analyzer =

The ASN.1 Analyzer will convert an ASN.1 encoded binary into Peach DOM.  This works fairly well, but I have run into a couple issues with the Python ASN.1 library.

In a couple cases the Binary -> Peach -> Binary was not 100% the same, I found there were some constructs that show up correctly when iterating through the them using the python library.  SO, YMMV.

Currently the ASN.1 Analyzer only works at run time attached to a Data Element.
