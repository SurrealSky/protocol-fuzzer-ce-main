= Placement (Peach 2.2) =

The placement element tell the data cracker that specific elements should be moved after the input stream is parsed.  This, combined with link:Seek.html[Seek] and the link:Relation.html[offset-of relation] are the ways Peach supports handling files that contain references to elements by offset.

Note: Placement only works when data is being parsed into the DataModel via an input Action or a Data statement pointing to a file.
