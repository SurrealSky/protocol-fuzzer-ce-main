== State ==

The State element is a child element of StateModel.  States are containers for link:Action.html[Action]s which are run top down.  A state model must contain at least one state (but could contain more).  States can be moved between using the link:changeState.html[changeState] action type.

States must contain at least one link:Action.html[Action].
