== constraint Attribute ==

This attribute allows you to specify a python expression that must evaluate to true in order for the data parser to consider the data element to have properly parsed/consumed some incoming data.  This attribute is ONLY used for parsing/cracking incoming data and does NOT affect how the value is mutated.

== Example ==

----
<Number constraint="int(value) & 0xfefe == 5" />
