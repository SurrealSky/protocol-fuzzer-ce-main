== Peach Reproduction Mode ==

The peach reproduction mode allows running a folder or files through peach with agents, monitors and logging.  The files will be run once at a time with no mutations applied.

To use the reproduction mode follow these instructions:

 * create a folder called repros that contains all of the reproduction files
 * make a copy of repros.xml and edit to add needed publishers and agents
 * run repros.xml via peachrepro.bat
