== Number ==

The Number element defines a binary number of lengths 8, 16, 24, 32, or 64 bits.  The Number element is a child element of DataModel, link:Block.html[Block], or link:Choice.html[Choice].

For numerical strings use a link:String.html[String] element with a link:NumericalString.html[NumericalString] hint. (Peach 2.3)
