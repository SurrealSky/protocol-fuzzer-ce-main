== Hint ==

Hints are extensions of link:Mutators.html[Mutators] that can be attached to data elements to provide the peach engine more information about the data that is being parsed and how it should treat it. For instance when a link:String.html[String] contains a number only the numerical tests contained within the string mutator would execute. However, if you add a link:NumericalString.html[NumericalString] hint to the link:String.html[String]  it will attach all the numerical mutators as well.
