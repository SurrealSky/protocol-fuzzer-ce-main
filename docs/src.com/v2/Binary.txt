== Binary Analyzer ==

Tha binary analyzer will perform some basic analysis of a binary blob of unknown data looking for strings, and string sizes.  It will then replace the link:Blob.html[Blob] element with a link:Block.html[Block] structure containing the broken out types.  Additionally it can locate simple relations ships in many cases and add them as well.

*Note:* Binary analyzer only works when attached to a data element.  It cannot be used from the command line.

== Future extensions ==

There are several planned extensions for the binary analyzer:

 * Locate compressed segments (Zip, etc)
 * Detect Base64 and other basic encodings
