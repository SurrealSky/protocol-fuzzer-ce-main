= Tutorial: Network Server Fuzzing =

Welcome to the network server fuzzing tutorial, part of the Peach Quickstart.  In this tutorial we are going to build a MySQL network fuzzer.  The specification we will use is http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_ClientServer_Protocol[here].  This format is complex enough to give you a good idea of how network fuzzing it performed in Peach and will show off several Peach features.  The target of this fuzzer is http://mysql.com/[MySQL], an open-source, cross-platform, database server.  We will be targetting the client protocol.
