== Peach Services ==

To support the development of Peach I offer commercial services billed at an hourly or project rate to provide the following services.

Availability and lead time vary, please contact mike@dejavusecurity.com for more information, rates, and scheduling.

All training is offered through my consulting company http://www.dejavusecurity.com[Deja vu Security].

== Custom Fuzzer Development ==

Don't have the time or technical ability to develop and use Peach?  Not to worry, you can hire a qualified member of the Peach development team to assist you or to develop it for you.

== Fuzzer Review ==

New to Peach and not sure you created a good fuzzer?  You can hire a member of the Peach development team to review your Pit file and any additional python extensions to verify the best possible coverage and provide suggestions on improvement.

== Support ==

Have you run into a bug or blocking problem and need more then just a mailing list to make sure you get past it fast?  Then your in luck, you can purchase a support case and a Peach developer will help you one-on-one to resolve the problem and patch Peach if needed.
