== WireSharkAnalyzer ==

This analyzer can convert PDML files into Peach Pits.  This process is not 100% perfect due to limitations in PDML, and differences in output from different Wireshark dissectors.  After converting you will need to review the Pit and make changes as needed.

The PDML you convert should contain a single packet.  This analyzer does not yet support converting a stream of packets.

_Command Line:_
----
peach --analyzer=shark.WireSharkAnalyzer in=dump.pdml out=pdml_pit.xml proto=bootp
