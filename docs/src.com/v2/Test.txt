== Test ==

The test element is used to configure a specific fuzzing test that combines a state model with a publisher and other configuration options such as including/excluding elements from being mutated, defining a path through the state model and a list of mutators to use.

[source,xml]
----
<Test name="TheTest">

  <!-- Optionally exclude some elements from mutation -->
  <Exclude xpath="//Reserved" />
  <Exclude xpath="//Magic" />

  <!-- Optional agent references -->
  <Agent ref="LocalAgent" />
  <Agent ref="RemoteAgent" />

  <!-- Indicate which state model to use (required) -->
  <StateModel ref="TheState" />

  <!-- Configure the publisher to use (required) -->
  <Publisher class="tcp.Tcp">
     <Param name="host" value="127.0.0.1" />
     <Param name="port" value="9001" />
  </Publisher>

</Test>

== Platform Specific Agents ==

Platform specific Agents can be defined with the platform attribute of the Agent nodes within a Test node. Platform specifiers must be lower case in order to be properly recognized.

<Test name="TheTest">

  <!-- Optional platform specific agent references -->
  <Agent ref="WinAgent" platform="windows" />
  <Agent ref="LinAgent" platform="linux" />
  <Agent ref="OSXAgent" platform="osx" />

  <!-- Indicate which state model to use (required) -->
  <StateModel ref="TheState" />

  <!-- Configure the publisher to use (required) -->
  <Publisher class="tcp.Tcp">
     <Param name="host" value="127.0.0.1" />
     <Param name="port" value="9001" />
