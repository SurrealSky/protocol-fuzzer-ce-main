== ARJ pit ==
Author: Dan Crowley

Fuzzer for ARJ archive files. Not a well supported format, but simple. My first one, so this may not be perfect. _Note: The Fixup tags in this aren't recognized by Peach Builder as of this writing and will cause it to hang. Requires "wee.arj" as a sample file and writes logs to C:\peach\logtest_

== AU pit ==
Author: Dan Crowley

Fuzzer for Sun Audio (.AU) files. A trivially simple format, might be interesting for beginners to look at. _Requires "wee.au" as a sample file and writes logs to C:\peach\logtest_

== RAR pit ==
Author: Jason Kratzer

Fuzzer for RAR archives. _Requires "test.rar" as a sample file.  Also requires Fixup "custom.py".  Logs are written to C:\peachfuzz\logs.  This Pit does not cover the full specification but will crack most files.  Also, several points for improvement such as adding BLOCK OF RELATIONs to a number of the block types._
