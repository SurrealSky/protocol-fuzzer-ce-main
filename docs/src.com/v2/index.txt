Peach Fuzzer
============

Peach is a SmartFuzzer that is capable of performing both link:GenerationFuzzing.html[generation] and link:MutationFuzzing.html[mutation] based fuzzing.

Peach requires the creation of PeachPit files that define the structure, type information, and relationships in the data to be fuzzed.  It additionally allows for the configuration of a fuzzing run including selecting a data transport (link:Publisher.html[Publisher]), logging interface, etc.

Peach has been under active development since 2004 and is in its second major version with the third currently under development.  Peach was created and is actively developed by http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeleddington[Michael Eddington] of http://www.dejavusecurity.com[Deja vu Security]

=== Peach 3.0 Released [05/13/2013] ===

I'm happy to announce Peach 3.0 bits are now available for download.  This marks the first stable release of the Peach 3 series
of development, a full re-write of Peach.

In other news we are shutting down the Peach mailing list in favor of the link:http://forums.peachfuzzer.com/[Peach forums].

=== Peach 3 Nightly Builds [04/26/2013] ===

Peach 3 development and bugfixing has been going non-stop, so we are now posting nightly builds that pass 
our unittests for all platforms.  The nightly builds are the recommended way to get the latest bug fixes and features.

=== Peach 3 Release Candidate 1 [02/07/2013] ===

Peach 3 Release Candidate 1 has been released today.  Peach 3 is now code complete and in active use. Peach 3 is a full re-write of
Peach using the Microsoft.NET framework and Mono for cross-platform support.  We have also
moved to a new source control system GIT.  Both the new GIT and older SVN repositories are
both hosted on Source Forge.

Now that Peach 3 is near to release you will see this site change to be more Peach 3 centric.

=== Peach 3 Training @ CanSecWest 2013 [01/08/2013] ===

I'm happy to announce that we will once again be offering the Peach training class @ CanSecWest!  This is a two day  hands on class during which you will learn how to use Peach to fuzz just about anything.

=== Web Site Changes [01/08/2013] ===

We have decided to move away from using a wiki to host our site and instead generate
static content that we can manage from GIT and re-use in other formats.  As such you 
may find a broken link or two.  If so please report to the peach mailing list. Thanks!

=== Peach 3 BETA 1 Released [09/24/2012] ===

I'm happy to announce the release of Peach 3 BETA 1!  Peach 3 is a full re-write of
Peach using the Microsoft.NET framework and Mono for cross-platform support.  We have also
moved to a new source control system GIT.  Both the new GIT and older SVN repositories are
both hosted on Source Forge.

In the coming weeks and months you will see this site change and become more Peach 3 centric.  For
now use the Peach 3 portion of the left side menu.

We are also going to move away from the Peach mailing list in favor of a forums site.  This is to allow
supporting multiple Peach versions (community & enterprise) and related features.  It should also make 
accessing older information easier with integrated search.

=== HotFuzz Released ===

For the several years I've had a Peach project on my todo list.  I've always wanted to utilize Wireshark's dissectors to create a man-in-the-middle (proxy) based fuzzer were the creation of a Peach pit was optional.  !HotFuzz is an implementation of this idea by a group of students from Prague.

=== Black Hat Vegas 2010 Training ===

We will once again be offering Peach training at Black Hat Vegas this summer.  This is a 
two day course with a heavy focus on creating working smart fuzzers.

=== Peach v2.3.6 Released [4/26/2010] ===

Two releases in one month, crazy!  This is mainly a bug fix release, but there are
a couple improvements.  First, a patch to support multiple Publishers has been added.
You can now configure multiple Publishers per Test and reference them by name at the
Action level in your state model.  Second, I have improved the speed of fuzzing, at
least for file fuzzing by improving the communication between Windows Debugger and
the Publisher.


 * New: Multiple Publishers are now supported by adding a "name" attribute
        to the <Publisher> element and a "publisher" attribute to <Action>.
 * Changed: Improved Agent to Publisher communication, increasing fuzzing speed
 * Changed: Improved osx.CrashReporter monitor.  More reliable now.
 * Bug: Fixed issue were Peach Validator would not always run analyzers
 * Bug: Updated WireShark Analyzer to use <DataModel> instead of <Template>
 * Bug: Fixed bug with ASCII strings containing char values over 127
 * Bug: Fixed bug in <Choice> fast checking.
 * Bug: Fixed minor issue with <Result> cracking (marked data as haveAll).
 * Bug: Fixed two bugs in UdpListener
 * Bug: StringMutator changed to set currentValue instead of finalValue.
        fixes bugs related to NULL termination or Unicode encodings.
 * Bug: Windows Debugger module didn't have CRLF line feeds causing
        notepad to display stacktrace wrong.
 * Bug: Random freeze while calculating frames in stack trace
 * Bug: Strings loose NULL termination when being mutated


=== Peach v2.3.5 Released [4/8/2010] ===

I finally got cut the v2.3.5 build.  This build has one of the longer change 
lists in the 2 series and should probably be called 2.4 :)  A number of new 
features have been added, including beta support for OS X Crash Reporter 
instead of a debugger (see samples/DebuggerCrashReporter.xml).  This release 
also includes a copy of the !exploitable, so it is no longer necessary to 
download it separately when you install windbg. 

Also with this release, I have posted a cut of the source along with the 
binary installers. 

 * New: minset promoted to first tier tool, now compiled 
 * New: Action when attribute has a new method available, 'getXml()' 
        to allow for using xpaths in when expressions. 
 * New: Action when attribute has access to the 'random' module 
 * New: Windows Debugger now has IgnoreSecondChanceGardPage option 
 * New: New reproduction strategy for running pre-fuzzed files. 
 * New: New default strategy is deterministic and random 
 * New: New more agressive Blob mutator 
 * New: Data fileName attribute can now specify multiple files. 
        This will only work with the random mutation strategy. 
        Files will be switched every 100 iterations by default, 
        but switchCount attribute can change that.  Unix glob 
        support ("folder/*/*.gif"), filename, or folder path. 
 * New: Tcp publisher has new "throttle" parameter to specify wait 
        time between connections. 
 * New: Windows debugger module now suppoerts attaching by PID 
 * New: !exploitable windbg module included in distribution 
 * New: Flags now supported enabling padding to behave like structs 
 * New: Cracking optimizations for Choice blocks added

 * Changed: Use random filename to move data between debugger threads 
 * Changed: Xml Analyzer, default string type now utf8 
 * Changed: Windows Debugger no longer takes mini-dump 
 * Changed: Enabled mutator ValidValuesMutator by default 
 * Changed: UnixDebugger updated to support new file fuzzing model 
 * Changed: Cracker will throw exception if it cannot size a Blob 
 * Changed: Optmized test cases for small Numbers 
 * Changed: Binary analyzer changes how it locates strings as needed 
 * Changed: Random mutation strategy more agressive 
 * Changed: Data loaded by <Data fileName=""/> failes we will exit 
 * Changed: Improved accuracy of count vs. actual rounds 
 * Changed: Unix Debugger now uses multiprocessing module 
 * Bug: Fixed a couple odd bugs in Flags/Flag

 * Bug: Cracker updated to better handle Choices inside of Choices 
 * Bug: Fixed bug in UnixDebugger & vtrace where threads are not 
        being released.

        being released. 
 * Bug: Fixed bug with relations and complex Choice blocks
