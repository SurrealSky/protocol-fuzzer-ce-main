== Training Overview ==

The entirety of the course is student centric, hands on, and lab intensive. On day one, students will be instructed on the use of the Peach Fuzzing Platform, from a practitioner's perspective, learning the ways in which Peach can be used to fuzz a variety of targets including network protocol parsers, ActiveX/COM interfaces, file parsers, APIs, and web services. Students will build and run fuzzers that target real world applications.

On the second day, students will be exposed to the internals of Peach for a developer's perspective. The Peach architecture and module interfaces will be explained in great detail as to equip students with the skills necessary to extend and adapt Peach to their custom needs. Students will then develop their own Peach extensions in a lab environment to reinforce these concepts.
