== Peach Loggers ==

Peach has an extensible logging system that allows users to store logs just about however they want (if you are willing to write a Peach Extension :) )  By default Peach ships with a single file system logger.

== logger.Filesystem ==

The file system logger will log to a specified path.  A folder is created containing the run name and time stamp.  Inside of this folder are the actual logs.  Until a fault is detected very little information is logged to conserve disk space.
