== Minimum Occurrence Attribute

The occurrence attributes are used to define how often an element can occur.  The _minOccurs_ attribute specifies the minimum number of times an element can occur.  The occurrence attributes _minOccurs_ and link:maxOccurs.html[maxOccurs] can be combined to provide the occurrence range of an element.  Occurrence attributes are used when cracking and producing/mutating data. Internally Peach will treat this element as an array.

Related attributes: link:maxOccurs.html[maxOccurs], link:occurs.html[occurs].
