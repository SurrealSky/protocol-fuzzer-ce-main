== Installing Peach 3 ==

The following sections list the steps needed to install Peach on different 
operating systems.  Peach 3 is a complete rewrite of Peach 2 utilizing 
Microsoft.NET/Mono and the C# language.  The features available are very 
similar in this first release to Peach 2 with the main changes being under 
the hood.  Our initial testing shows Peach 3 to be 3-4 times faster than Peach 2.3.
