== Minimum Occurrence Attribute

The occurrence attributes are used to define how often an element can occur.  The _maxOccurs_ attribute specifies the maximum number of times an element can occur.  The occurrence attributes _maxOccurs_ and link:minOccurs.html[minOccurs] can be combined to provide the occurrence range of an element.  Occurrence attributes are used when cracking and producing/mutating data. Internally Peach will treat this element as an array.

Related attributes: link:minOccurs.html[minOccurs], link:occurs.html[occurs].
