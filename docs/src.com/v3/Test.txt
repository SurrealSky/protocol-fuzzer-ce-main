== Test ==

The Test element is used to configure a specific fuzzing test that combines a StateModel with a Publisher and other configuration options such as including/excluding elements from being mutated, Agents, and fuzzing strategies.

Multiple Test elements are supported, simply provide the name of the test element to use
on the Peach command line.

NOTE: When running Peach, the Test element named "Default" will be run if a test name is
not provided on the command line.
