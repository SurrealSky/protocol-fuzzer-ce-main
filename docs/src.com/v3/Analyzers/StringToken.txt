== String Token Analyzer ==

The String Token Analyzer will create a tokenized tree from a string based on punctuation used.  For example the string "?key=value&key2=value" would create a tree like the following:

----
              +---[key]
              |
       [?]---[=]
       |      |
       |      +---[value]
Root --+
       |      +---[key2]
       |      |
       [&]---[=]   
              |
              +---[value2]
----


This allows Peach to perform mutations that can expose bugs in parsers for this type of string.

Currently the String Token Analyzer only works at runtime when attached to a data element.
