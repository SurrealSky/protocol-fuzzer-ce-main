== Creating Data Models ==

Now we are going to dive right in.  Lets start by making a copy of +template.xml+ (found in your Peach folder) to +png.xml+.  This will hold all of the information about our PNG dumb fuzzer.  You will also want several samples PNG files (start with 10).

Go ahead and load up +png.xml+ into your XML editor.

For our dumb fuzzer we will only need one data model that will hold all the data from the PNG file.  The data model will not know anything about the PNG data structure, instead keeping all the data in a "Blob" element (binary large object, or byte array).

== Creating the DataModel ==

Okay, head over to your +png.xml+ file and lets start writing some XML!  Locate the link:../DataModel.html[DataModel] called _TheDataModel_ is should look something like this:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- TODO: Create data model -->
<DataModel name="TheDataModel">
</DataModel>
----


Read more about: link:../DataModel.html[DataModel]

We are going to add a single data element to our data model as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<DataModel name="TheDataModel">
    <Blob />
</DataModel>
----


Read more about: link:../DataModel.html[DataModel], link:../Blob.html[Blob]

Okay, that's all we need for our data model.  The "Blob" element will end up holding all of our PNG data.
