== Placement

The placement element tell the data cracker that specific elements should be moved after the input stream is parsed.  This, combined with link:Relation.html[offset-of relation] are the ways Peach supports handling files that contain references to elements by offset.

NOTE: Placement only works when data is being parsed into the DataModel via an input Action or a Data statement pointing to a file.
