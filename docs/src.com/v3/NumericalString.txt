== NumericalString ==

The NumericalString hint can only be used with link:String.html[String] elements 
to indicate it's value is a number.  When this hint is used it activates all 
of the numerical mutators along with the standard string mutators.

*Note:* If the default value of a string is a number, the NumericalString hint
is automatically added.
