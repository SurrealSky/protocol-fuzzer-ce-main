== Minimum Set ==

This tool will run each sample file through a target program and determine code coverage.  It will then find the least number of files needed to cover the most code.  This will be the minimum set of files that should be used when fuzzing.

Peach Minset is used to locate the minimum set of sample data with
the best code coverage metrics to use while fuzzing.  This process
can be distributed out across multiple machines to decrease the run
time.

There are two steps to the process:

  1. Collect traces       [long process]
  2. Compute minimum set  [short process]

The first step, collecting traces, can be distributed and the results
collected for analysis by step #2.

Collect Traces
 --------------

Perform code coverage using all files in the 'samples' folder.  Collect
the .trace files for later analysis.

Syntax:
  PeachMinset [-k] -s samples -t traces command.exe args %s

Note:
  %s will be replaced by sample filename.

Compute Minimum Set
 -------------------

Analyzes all .trace files to determin the minimum set of samples to use
during fuzzing.

Syntax:
  PeachMinset -s samples -t traces -m minset


All-In-One
 ----------

Both tracing and computing can be performed in a single step.

Syntax:
  PeachMinset [-k] -s samples -m minset command.exe args %s

Note:
  %s will be replaced by sample filename.


Distributing Minset
 -------------------

Minset can be distributed by splitting up the sample files and
distributing the collecting of traces to multiple machines.  The
final compute minimum set cannot be distributed.
