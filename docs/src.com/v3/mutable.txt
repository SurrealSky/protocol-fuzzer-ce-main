== Mutable Attribute ==

Mutable is used to define if this element, block, or datatype should be fuzzed. The default value is true.

NOTE: Even when an element is marked as non-mutable it will still be modified as the fuzzer fuzzes the other elements.  Marking an element as non-mutable will only disable the mutators that would have operated on that element.

TIP: It is our experience that marking elements as non-mutable leads to missing faults.  We recommend not using this attribute unless you really know what your doing and know that the marked alements have already been fuzzed.
