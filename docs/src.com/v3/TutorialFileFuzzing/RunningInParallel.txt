== Running in Parallel ==

We have a nice optimized fuzzer now, but we still want to get our fuzzing done faster and
it just so happens we have a couple extra machines sitting around just begging to be used for fuzzing.
Luckily Peach supports parallel fuzzing, and it's super easy.
All we need to do is add a single command line argument and run our fuzzer on each machine.
Here is how we do it:

== 1. Configure Machines ==

First we need to configure each machine to have:

 . Peach
 . Target application
 . +wav.xml+
 . +sample.wav+

== 2. Run Peach ==

Next we just run the fuzzer on each machine.  We can launch peach using this syntax:

*Machine #1*
----
c:\peach\peach.exe -p3,1 wav.xml
----


*Machine #2*
----
c:\peach\peach.exe -p3,2 wav.xml
----


*Machine #3*
----
c:\peach\peach.exe -p3,3 wav.xml
----


Notice that we are adding an argument "-p" to the command line with two numbers.
The first number indicates the total number of machines we will use.
The second number indicates the machine we are running Peach on.

EASY!
