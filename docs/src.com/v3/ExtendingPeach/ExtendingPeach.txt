== Extending Peach ==

Peach has been designed to be easy to extend.  Extensions are picked up using a process called reflection in which 
assemblies (.NET DLL's) are found and examined for extensions that should be used by the system.  As such, no
Peach code must be changed to add an extension, just place your extension DLL in the Peach folder and go.

Development of a Peach extension on Windows requires Visual Studio to build your assembly.  On OS X or Linux the
Mono runtime is used and has a free compiler/runtime.

Areas of easy extension:

 * *DataElement* -- Types used to model data (String, Number, etc)
 * *link:CustomFixup.html[Fixup]* -- Typically used for updating Checksums, etc.
 * *Transformer* -- Static transforms on data such as ZIP/Base64 encode/decode
 * *link:CustomPublisher.html[Publisher]* -- I/O Interfaces
 * *Mutator* -- Perform mutations on the data/state model
 * *Fuzzing Strategy* -- Control how fuzzing is performed
 * *Agent Channel* -- Communications between Peach and a Peach Agent
 * *link:CustomMonitor.html[Monitor]* -- Fault detection and data collection classes hosted by agents (local or remote)
 * *link:CustomLogger.html[Logger]* -- Module used to log information from fuzzing run.
