== Name Attribute ==

Almost every element in a Peach Pit file supports the name attribute.  Names are used for readability and link:ref.html[referencing] other elements in a Pit file.

Names should not contain punctuation, in particular period (.), slash (\\), or colon (:) as they have special meaning for link:ref.html[references].

Names are case sensitive and must be unique at the current scope level.

=== Examples ===

_Correct:_

The following example has unique names for each element.

[source,xml]
----
<Block name="Header">
  <Number name="Value1" size="8"/>
  <Number name="Value2" size="8"/>
  <Number name="Value3" size="8"/>
  <Number name="Value4" size="8"/>
</Block>
----

The following example does not provide names for all values which is also okay.

[source,xml]
----
<Block name="Header">
  <Number size="8"/>
  <Number size="8"/>
  <Number size="8"/>
  <Number size="8"/>
</Block>
----

_Incorrect:_

The following has duplicate names at the same document level.  This will cause an error.

[source,xml]
----
<Block name="Header">
  <Number name="Value" size="8"/>
  <Number name="Value" size="8"/>
  <Number name="Value" size="8"/>
  <Number name="Value" size="8"/>
</Block>
----
