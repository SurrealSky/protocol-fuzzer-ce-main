== Occurs Attribute ==

A combination of link:minOccurs.html[minOccurs] and link:maxOccurs.html[maxOccurs]. This attribute creates exactly that number of the data element it is specified for. Internally Peach will treat this element as an array.

=== Examples ===

[source,xml]
----

<Block name="OccursBlock" occurs="5">
  <String name="occurs" value="A"/>
</Block>
----


Will produce the output:

AAAAA
