== Smart Fuzzer ==

Smart fuzzers refer to fuzzers that have additional information about the data and state they are fuzzing.  Typically the base line for a smart fuzzer is to understand the type information in the data that is being mutated.  Peach takes this further by modeling the following:

 * Type information
 * Basic relationships such as size, and count
 * Checksum and other types of data validation
 * Static transformations such as ZIP, and Base64
 * Basic state modeling
