== Buckets

Buckes of duplicate faults.

[source,java]
----
// Buckets of faults that are deemed similar
// or the same.
//
// NOTE: Currently buckets are specific to job
//       however, in the future buckets will
//       sometimes span multiple jobs or target
//       versions. By keeping the data currently
//       stored sparse we leave room for expanding
//       usage in the future.
