*Versioning*

Versioning is largely hidden from the user and is a revision history of all changes to the pit. This
is done so we can have a link between jobs and the exact pit used on the job. Via PF UI the user could
ask to see the "revision history", but we are not making that a focus of any workflow. (e.g. you 
would not create a new job with an old pit.)
